<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>I extremely recommend using this service. Very reputable incredibly great. Took care of a part that was not covered under warranty quickly and efficient and did not have to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Terrific company started by a man who is aiming to grow his company and protect his family. He set up a complete system inside and out. Excellent system and an excellent cost. I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it twice a year with out having to be reminded to do it.<p>

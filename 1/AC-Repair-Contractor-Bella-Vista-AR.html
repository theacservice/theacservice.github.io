<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that many Seattleites will just utilize sparingly, but because heat pumps can supply both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home may not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To discover odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

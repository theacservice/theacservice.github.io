<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

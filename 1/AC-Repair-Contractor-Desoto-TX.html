Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your home won't be heated up sufficiently and the system will have to constantly run to attempt to heat the whole house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>My eldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

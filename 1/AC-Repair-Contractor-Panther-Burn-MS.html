<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>

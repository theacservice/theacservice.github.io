Breathing air pollutants can cause allergic and asthmatic reactions, infections and other illness that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>There are some more serious threats for HVAC employees that might be possibly fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be poisonous. As HVAC technicians regularly come into contact with electrical wiring, they risk being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of burns and abrasions to the skin. Although there are risks associated with the task, it is usually performed securely as long as proper care is taken.<p>

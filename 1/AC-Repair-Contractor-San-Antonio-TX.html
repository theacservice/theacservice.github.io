<p>The use of air filters can trap some of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource section recommends that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to decrease the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can minimize the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years ago.<p>

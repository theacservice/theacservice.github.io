<p>Details offered in this security guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Buildings constantly progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously engaging, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing a little over time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

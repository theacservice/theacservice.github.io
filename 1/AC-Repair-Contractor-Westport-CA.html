Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4).

The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

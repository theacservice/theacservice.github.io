<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really useful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and harden-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>

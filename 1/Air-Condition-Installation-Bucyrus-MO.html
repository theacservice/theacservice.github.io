<p>Improve your services, make more services revenue, and offer an incredible consumer experience. To make certain the system you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to determine the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we do not just replace it with the very same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into account things such as the size of your house, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is essential so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

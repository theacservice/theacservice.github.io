<p>Let's start by outlining the preparation that needs to happen prior to you in fact purchase a furnace. Selecting a furnace for your house isn't as easy as choosing one off a showroom floor. Not all furnaces benefit all homes, and there are a number of factors that definitely need to be considered before picking one. First, you'll need one that is correctly sized for your home.

For example, you can set the thermostat to reduce the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy bills and make sure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will inspect the thermostat throughout the yearly maintenance to ensure the real temperature and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a distinction in the temperature, the technician needs to examine the thermostat's efficiency or evaluate the whole HVAC system.<p>

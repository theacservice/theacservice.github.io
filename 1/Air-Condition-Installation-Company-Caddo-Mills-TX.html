Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective.

As an outcome your oil or gas furnace might run longer to supply the exact same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy bills to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies each month might be used to help you spend for a new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating bills with heating expenses from the previous years. It's time to change your furnace if there is a considerable difference.<p>

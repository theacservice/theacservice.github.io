<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect change, frequently indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you acquire a brand-new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>

I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke with from beginning to end were extremely expert, considerate and the work was really effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Understand in Mill Creek WA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

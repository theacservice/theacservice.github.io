<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually become a crucial problem to house owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution studies have determined several contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne item of a biological contaminant. Biological impurities in the house may consist of mold, germs, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' illness. They also can trigger allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.

<p>Property owners might also assume that because a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their house's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts property worths.

Perhaps Realtors need to think about too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may add to, or subtract from, any offered asking price. That said, homebuyers looking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>

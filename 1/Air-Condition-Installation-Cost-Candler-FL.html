<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

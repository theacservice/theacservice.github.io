<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The capability of organic chemicals to trigger health results varies significantly, from those that are highly hazardous, to those with no known health impact.

At present, very little is learnt about what health impacts take place from the levels of organics usually found in homes. Lots of organic substances are understood to cause cancer in animals; some are presumed of triggering, or are known to trigger, cancer in humans.<p>

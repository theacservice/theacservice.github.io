<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's 5 years old or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the same quantity of cooling.<p>

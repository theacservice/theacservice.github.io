<h3>AC Maintenance in Oakland FL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.

All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

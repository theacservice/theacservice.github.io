<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow.

Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

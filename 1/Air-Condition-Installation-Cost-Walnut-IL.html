Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating system and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these significant but small adjustments in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental factors.<p>

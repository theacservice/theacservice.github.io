<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>

<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

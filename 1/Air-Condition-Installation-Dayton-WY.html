<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health impacts discussed.

In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health effects is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed impacts might occur.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>

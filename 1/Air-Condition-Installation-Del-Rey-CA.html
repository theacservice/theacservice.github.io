<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>

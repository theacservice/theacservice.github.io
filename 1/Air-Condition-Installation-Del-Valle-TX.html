<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Del Valle TX</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>

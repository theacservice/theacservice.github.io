<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>All cooling contractors need to begin their evaluation of your home by carrying out an A/c Contractors of America Handbook J load estimation. This determines the heat gain your house is subject to. The estimation is fairly simple to perform and will expose what size system you need. If the one you're considering wants to determine the right unit for your house solely on experience, move on to another contractor. Though strongly affected by where you live, a number of factors affect the size unit required, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of windows and doors; and the orientation of your house to the sun. The computation can also signal you to the possible benefits of updating the insulation in your house.

<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

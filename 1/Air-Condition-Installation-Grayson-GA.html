Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

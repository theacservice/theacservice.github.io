After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

The air conditioner might cycle continuously or act unpredictably if the sensor is knocked out of position.

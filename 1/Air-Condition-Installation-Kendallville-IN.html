Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Knightdale NC</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

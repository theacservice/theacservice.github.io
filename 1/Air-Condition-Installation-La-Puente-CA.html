Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipelines are hardly ever used due to long-term destructive concerns. Virtually all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely flexible, will not rust and comes in long lengths, which enable PEX pipeline to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>

The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

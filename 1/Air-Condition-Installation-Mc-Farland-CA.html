<p>Both should be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

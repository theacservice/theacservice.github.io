<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

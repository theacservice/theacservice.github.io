<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems at Mount Gilead NC</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Systems in Mount Gilead NC</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment.

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.

Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J calculation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, determining the correct size of unit for your house likewise depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are lowering expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

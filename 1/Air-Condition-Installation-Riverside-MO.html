<p>The installation was quickly, expert and very well done. The installers were polite and knew exactly what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge quickly people who are good at what they do.

I extremely extremely advise the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>

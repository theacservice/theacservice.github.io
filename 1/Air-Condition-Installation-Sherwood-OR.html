Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again.

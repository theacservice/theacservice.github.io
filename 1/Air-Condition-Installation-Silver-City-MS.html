For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>

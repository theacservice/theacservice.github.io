<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<h3>Window Air Conditioner in South Lyon Michigan</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside.

<p>Central air units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

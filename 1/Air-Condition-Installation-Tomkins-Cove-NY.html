<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

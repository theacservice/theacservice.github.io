<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heating systems can heat your home. Honestly, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>

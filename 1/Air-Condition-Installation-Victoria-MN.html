He devoted to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

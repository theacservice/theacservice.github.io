<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, compressor, and evaporator are all located in one cabinet, which usually is placed on a roof or on a concrete slab beside your house's foundation. This type of air conditioner likewise is utilized in small commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the house's outside wall or roof to get in touch with the packaged air conditioning system, which is typically situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioning system frequently consist of electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of air conditioning unit and central heating unit gets rid of the need for a separate furnace inside your home.<p>

Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Wylie TX</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

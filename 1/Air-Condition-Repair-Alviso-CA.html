<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.

<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused.

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>

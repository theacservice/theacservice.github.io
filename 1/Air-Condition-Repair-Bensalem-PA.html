<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

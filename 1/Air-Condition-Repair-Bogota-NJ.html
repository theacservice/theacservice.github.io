<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Airborne irritants are simply a truth of life. Molds can trigger flare-ups of allergic reaction signs, and in some cases, trigger asthma attacks. Bacteria, germs, and infections also can reside in the air you breathe every day. These airborne pollutants can affect your house comfort devices, too. Permitted to circulate through your house and your system, these and other particles can build up on the indoor coil, hindering air flow and lowering heating and cooling performance. By using the services and items we offer, you can minimize and typically get rid of these undesirable air-borne contaminants from your house, leaving tidy air and safe surfaces throughout your home.<p>

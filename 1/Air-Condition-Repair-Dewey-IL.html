<p>A geothermal heating system is more trusted than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy relies on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and readily available source of energy.<p>

<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest considerable savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Basically, SEER offers more information based on how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To spot smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>

At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate effects that are frequently incorrect for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, tiredness and disorientation. The effects of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>

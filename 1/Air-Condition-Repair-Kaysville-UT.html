<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Kids may have greater exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

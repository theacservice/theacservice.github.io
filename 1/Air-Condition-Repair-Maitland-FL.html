<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.

All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>

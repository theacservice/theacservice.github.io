<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

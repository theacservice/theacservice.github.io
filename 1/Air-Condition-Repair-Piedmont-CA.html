<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>

We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Stanchfield MN</h3>
<p>Many people know that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have significant, hazardous result. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of pollutants may be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

<p>Just like the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can differ commonly based upon the size of the home. Many heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners ought to consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

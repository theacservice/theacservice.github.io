<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main issue in majority the workplace indoor air investigations it has conducted. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the very same to be real. These investigations exposed that proper ventilation is necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences.

<p>Generally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions.

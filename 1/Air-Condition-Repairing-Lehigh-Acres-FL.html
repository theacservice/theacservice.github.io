<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system.

Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

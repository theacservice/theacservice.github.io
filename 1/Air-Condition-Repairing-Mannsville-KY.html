<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, causing fractures and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>

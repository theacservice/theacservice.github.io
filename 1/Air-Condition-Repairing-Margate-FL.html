<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year.

Some companies offer top priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

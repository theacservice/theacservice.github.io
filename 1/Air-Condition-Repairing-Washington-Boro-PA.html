<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 ought to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of illness caused by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and gastrointestinal issues.<p>

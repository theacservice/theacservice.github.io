<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Banning CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Iâ $ m truly fussy with my things. I like my devices and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So buying this air conditioning system to replace my old one was rather of a challenging reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am grateful I got this though due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in excellent manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Carrier I got because I purchased it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c might end up being very filthy. These aspects of the devices are important for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and checks connections to guarantee they are protected. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic parts are examineded for correct function and total condition. This is an outstanding opportunity to recognize parts that are worn or faulty. Changing them to repair the a/c might be a lot less expensive when the problem is relatively minor.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

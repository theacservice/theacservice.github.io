<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

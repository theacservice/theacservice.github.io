<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips.

For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Usually the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not toxic, but might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to collect.

If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>

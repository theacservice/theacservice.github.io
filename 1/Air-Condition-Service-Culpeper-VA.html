<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Dousman WI</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require fairly little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water locations). The systems ought to be inspected at least two times annually for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>

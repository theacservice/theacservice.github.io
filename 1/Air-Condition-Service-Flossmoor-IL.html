<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment.

The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

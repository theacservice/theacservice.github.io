<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold development and should be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can flourish in hidden or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>

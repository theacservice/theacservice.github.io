They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.

He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>

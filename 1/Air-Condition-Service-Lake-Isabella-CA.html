<p>Oil heating systems are usually not very efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not achieve an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too since a drain needs to be installed.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service. If the existing system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

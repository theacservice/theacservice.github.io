<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step.

Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

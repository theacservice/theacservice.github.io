<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

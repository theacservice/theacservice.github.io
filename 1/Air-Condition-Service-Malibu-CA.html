<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

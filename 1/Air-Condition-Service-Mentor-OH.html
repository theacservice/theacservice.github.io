Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Normally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>

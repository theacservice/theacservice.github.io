<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>

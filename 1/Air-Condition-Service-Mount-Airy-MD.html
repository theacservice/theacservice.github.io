<p>We advise using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes.

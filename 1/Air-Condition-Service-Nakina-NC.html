<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Heating systems that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>

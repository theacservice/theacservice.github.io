<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered extraordinary, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, appealing and reliable. He clearly and thoroughly described all issues and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his capability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a momentary repair to a problem that could not be solved on the first check out due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>

<p>If your furnace has simply died in sub-zero temperature levels or your a/c unit has actually gone kaput on a sweltering day, you'll probably be happy to employ the first repairman who pertains to your home that day.

<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor starts however the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

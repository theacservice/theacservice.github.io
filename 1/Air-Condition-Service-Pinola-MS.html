<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Pinola MS</h3>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

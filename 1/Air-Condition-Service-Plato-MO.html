<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

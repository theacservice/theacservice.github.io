<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if required, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>

<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a house.

<p>As with many house improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the house.

Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>

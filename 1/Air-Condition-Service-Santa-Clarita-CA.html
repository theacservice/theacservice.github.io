<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of environment-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure motion. Green projects accounted for 20 percent of all recently constructed homes in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article anticipated that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates.

Soil by roadways and highways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before getting in the house. If you deal with lead in your task or a pastime, change your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes individually.

Attempt to keep your children from eating dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come within.<p>

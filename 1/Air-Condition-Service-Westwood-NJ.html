<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team excels in incorporating a multidisciplinary method to indoor air quality (IAQ) difficulties. When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you pick for your home.

<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Self-installation tends to develop more issues than it solves.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team excels in incorporating a multidisciplinary method to indoor air quality (IAQ) difficulties. When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you pick for your home.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

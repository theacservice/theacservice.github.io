<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

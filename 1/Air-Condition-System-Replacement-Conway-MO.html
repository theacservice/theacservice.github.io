As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

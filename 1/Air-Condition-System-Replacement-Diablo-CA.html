<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To ensure the system is working successfully, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>

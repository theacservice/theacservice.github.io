<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

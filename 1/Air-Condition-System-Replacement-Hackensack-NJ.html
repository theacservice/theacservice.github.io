Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>

When the air conditioning system works however your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Kents Store VA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

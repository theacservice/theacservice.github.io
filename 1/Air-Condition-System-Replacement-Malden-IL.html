<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

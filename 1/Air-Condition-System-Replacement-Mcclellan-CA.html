<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

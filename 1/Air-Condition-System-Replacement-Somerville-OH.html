The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

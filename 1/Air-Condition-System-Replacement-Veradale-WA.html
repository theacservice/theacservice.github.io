<h3>Air Condition Installation in Veradale Washington</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years back.<p>

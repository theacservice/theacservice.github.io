<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure materials, cigarette smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in produced products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing hot and cold air throughout your house, providing a comfy environment in every room. But ducts that are not set up appropriately or maintained can distribute pollutants from one space to another. In time, dust, dander and even mold can build up in your ducts, lowering the total air quality. Hire an expert to ensure your ducts are circulating fresh, tidy air.<p>

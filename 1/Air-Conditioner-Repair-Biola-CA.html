<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and germs, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites must discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

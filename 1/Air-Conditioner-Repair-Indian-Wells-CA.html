The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>

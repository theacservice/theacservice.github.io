However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products present a threat only when they are managed in a manner that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled.

This can result in the potential for significant illness.<p>

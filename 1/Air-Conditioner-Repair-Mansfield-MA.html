<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, particularly given that we invest most of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

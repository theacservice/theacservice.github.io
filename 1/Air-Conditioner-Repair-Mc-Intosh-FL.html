<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Mc Intosh Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Selecting the right size ac system is an important part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with.

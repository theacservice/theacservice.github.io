<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>

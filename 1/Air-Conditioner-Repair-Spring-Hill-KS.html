<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the a/c service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same method as a cars and truck radiator or typical household ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment.

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

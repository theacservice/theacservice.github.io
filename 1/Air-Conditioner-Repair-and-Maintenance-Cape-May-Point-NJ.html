<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job.

So, make sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>

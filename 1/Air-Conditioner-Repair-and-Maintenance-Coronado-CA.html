<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>

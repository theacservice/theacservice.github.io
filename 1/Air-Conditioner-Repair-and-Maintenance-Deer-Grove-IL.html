<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>

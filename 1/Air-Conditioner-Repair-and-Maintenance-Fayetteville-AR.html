<p>A geothermal desuperheater is helpful and really efficient, particularly throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's house.

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>

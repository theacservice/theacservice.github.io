<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Ac system producers normally make rugged, high quality products. Start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool off for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>

<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection.

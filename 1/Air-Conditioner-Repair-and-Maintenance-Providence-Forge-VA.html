<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one reaction specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, causing cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>

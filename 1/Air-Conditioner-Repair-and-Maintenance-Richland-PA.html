<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

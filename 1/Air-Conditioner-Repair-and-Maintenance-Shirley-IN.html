They supply friendly service, quality work, and truthful knowledge. Feedback from our customers has actually been overwhelmingly favorable.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a few years earlier.<p>

To put it simply, they are best for our Seattle climate! They are extremely efficient, vanquishing most other types of heating unit in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. Nevertheless, a geothermal installation usually costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which typically suggests it fails in regards to return on investment.<p>

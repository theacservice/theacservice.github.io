<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad.

A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

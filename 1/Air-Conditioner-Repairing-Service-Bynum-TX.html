<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

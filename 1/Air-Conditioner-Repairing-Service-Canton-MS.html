<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every three months. During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

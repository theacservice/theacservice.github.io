<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Chatham New Jersey</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

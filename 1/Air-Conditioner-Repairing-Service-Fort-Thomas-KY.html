<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Fort Thomas KY?</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have been completed, the last task is to test the system to make sure it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to turn on may simply involve a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any problems or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where proper.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or even relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Lots of indoor air toxins originate from the kitchen. Gas stoves release hazardous pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

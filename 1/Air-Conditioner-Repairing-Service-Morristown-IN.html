Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps drastically change structures in manner ins which may be important to their own stability or their effect on building residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

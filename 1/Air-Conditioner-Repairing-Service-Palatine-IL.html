<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He assisted me problem shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

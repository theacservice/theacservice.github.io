<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the correct size of system for your home also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Poorly situated outdoor air consumption vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>

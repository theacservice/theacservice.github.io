<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators used toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

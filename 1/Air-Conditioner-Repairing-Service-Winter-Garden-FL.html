<p>As noted, inappropriate temperature and humidity levels, and too little or too much air blood circulation might also add to employee health grievances. Temperature level levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation should be avoided. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air flow will assist to minimize the event of upper respiratory signs, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Winter Springs FL Home</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

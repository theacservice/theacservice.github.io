<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems brought on by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>

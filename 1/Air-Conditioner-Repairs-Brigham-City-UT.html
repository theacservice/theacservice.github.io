What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

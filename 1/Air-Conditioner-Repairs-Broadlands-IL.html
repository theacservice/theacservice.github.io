Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. In addition, certain fuels and devices may need unique permits, and there is minimal versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the home.<p>

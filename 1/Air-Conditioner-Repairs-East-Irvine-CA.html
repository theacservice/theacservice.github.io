<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences.

<p>Lots of people are becoming more concerned and mindful about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of allergens and contaminants can cover the cooling ductwork with time.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

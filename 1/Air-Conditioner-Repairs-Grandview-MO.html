<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team masters integrating a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost evaluation bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you pick for your house.

<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other perks. Some companies provide priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>

Yearly furnace service might also be a requirement to keep your furnace guarantee valid also. Many producers state on guarantee documentation that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC provider are a part of the service warranty conditions.

<p>Both need to be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

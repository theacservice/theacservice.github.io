<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

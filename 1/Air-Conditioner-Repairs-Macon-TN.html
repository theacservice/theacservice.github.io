<p>Heatpump are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that the majority of Seattleites will only use sparingly, but due to the fact that heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

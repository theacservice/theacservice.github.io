<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Property owners might also presume that since a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a house improvement, its installation will right away raise their house's worth.

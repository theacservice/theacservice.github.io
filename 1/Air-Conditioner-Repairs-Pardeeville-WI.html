<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

Maybe Real estate agents should consider too many variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system might contribute to, or subtract from, any given asking price. That said, homebuyers looking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>

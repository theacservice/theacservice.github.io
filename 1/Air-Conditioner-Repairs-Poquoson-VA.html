<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient.

There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.

More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>

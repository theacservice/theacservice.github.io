<h3>Passive Ventilation in Port Hueneme California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>

They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My wife said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have met in a long time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.

Combustion items from car exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, space heating systems, fragrant candles, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not appropriately vented can produce carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

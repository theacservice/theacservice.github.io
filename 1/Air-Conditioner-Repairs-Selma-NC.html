<h3>Heating And Cooling Near Me in Selma North Carolina</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>

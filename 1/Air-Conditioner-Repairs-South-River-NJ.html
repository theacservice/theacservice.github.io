<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in South River NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke.

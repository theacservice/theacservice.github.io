Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

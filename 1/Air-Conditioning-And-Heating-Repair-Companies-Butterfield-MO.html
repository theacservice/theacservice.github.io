Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

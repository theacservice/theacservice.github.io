<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; floor, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can exacerbate problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>

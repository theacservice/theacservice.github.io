<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

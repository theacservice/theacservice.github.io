<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be incredibly efficient in terms of cost. If you have access to complimentary or cheap fire wood, or you cut your own wood from your timber, it might not cost you anything.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

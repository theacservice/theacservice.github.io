<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care products.

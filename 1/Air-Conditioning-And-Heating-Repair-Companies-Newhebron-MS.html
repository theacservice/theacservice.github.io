<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue.

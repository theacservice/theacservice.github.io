<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too little or excessive air circulation.

<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building residents might be exposed to a variety of impurities (in the form of gases and particles) from office devices, cleaning items, building and construction carpets, home furnishings and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor contaminants.

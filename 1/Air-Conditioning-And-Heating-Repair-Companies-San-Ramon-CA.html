<p>Another pollutant of indoor air is outdoor air.

Although air conditioning does not filter the air, it helps people with asthma because doors and windows are kept shut, which assists keep pollens and other outside irritants and irritants out of the home.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems.

This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

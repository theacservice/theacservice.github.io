<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>

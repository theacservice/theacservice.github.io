<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

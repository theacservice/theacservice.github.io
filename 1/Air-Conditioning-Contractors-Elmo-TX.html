<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>

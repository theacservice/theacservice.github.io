<h3>Home AC Repair in Georgetown IN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied extraordinary, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction style gets along, reliable and interesting. He clearly and completely described all issues and repairs in a manner that made me confident in his capability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to sustain another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to an issue that couldn't be resolved on the first go to due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and houses matters, particularly considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the conventional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air pollutants.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales guy concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Minneola FL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Port Clinton PA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>

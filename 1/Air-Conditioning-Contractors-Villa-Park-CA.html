<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Villa Park CA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using clever technology. Martin said the company can develop a dashboard within the structure's controls that will offer data on its systems to permit real time exposure, providing the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial customer, not just throughout brand-new building and construction.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

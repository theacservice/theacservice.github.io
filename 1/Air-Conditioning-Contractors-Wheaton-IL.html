<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>

<p>I am an investor, I need to replace two heating systems in a 8000square foot home. You can count on us to finish the job right.

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and very large homes. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The early few years of your service are an interesting time, and it's tempting to let pure enthusiasm direct your path forward. However if you desire your new HVAC business to have staying power, you should step back and commit the necessary time to establishing a service plan. And keep in mind that a business plan for an HVAC company isn't suggested to be a fixed file. It's a structure to direct the launch or revamp of your business that you can build on and restructure as the business develops.<p>

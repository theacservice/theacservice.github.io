<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

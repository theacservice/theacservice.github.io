<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has conducted. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>

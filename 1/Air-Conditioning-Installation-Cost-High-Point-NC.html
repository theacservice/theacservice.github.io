A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

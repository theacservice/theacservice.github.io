<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

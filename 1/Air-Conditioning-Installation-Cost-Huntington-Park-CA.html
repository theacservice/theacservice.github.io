My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way.

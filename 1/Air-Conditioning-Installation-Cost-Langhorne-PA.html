<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive effects of lead. Children might have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>

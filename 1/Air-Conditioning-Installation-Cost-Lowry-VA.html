<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was known how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>

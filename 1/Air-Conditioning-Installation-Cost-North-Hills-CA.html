<h3>Heat Pump Installation in North Hills CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>

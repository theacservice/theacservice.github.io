However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

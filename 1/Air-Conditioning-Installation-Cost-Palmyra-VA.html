<p>While pollutants typically discovered in indoor air are accountable for numerous hazardous effects, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are required to produce specific health problems. People also react extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Further research study is required to better understand which health effects take place after direct exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations found in homes and which occur from the higher concentrations that occur for short amount of times.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

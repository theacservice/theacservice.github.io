<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

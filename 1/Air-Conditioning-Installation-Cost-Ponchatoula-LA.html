<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

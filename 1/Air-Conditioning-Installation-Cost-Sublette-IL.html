<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request.

Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

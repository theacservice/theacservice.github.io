<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for commercial and residential HVAC companies. HVAC professionals undergo a variety of potentially hazardous conditions. Specialists are frequently needed to work in confined areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of homes. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather condition for extended periods of time. Given that they are called to structures without working environment control, they are likewise subject to the severe hot or cold temperature levels existing inside an area.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>

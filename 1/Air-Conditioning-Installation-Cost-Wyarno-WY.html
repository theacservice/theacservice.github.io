<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

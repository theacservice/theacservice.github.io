<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

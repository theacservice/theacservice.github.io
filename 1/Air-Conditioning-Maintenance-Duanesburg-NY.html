<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

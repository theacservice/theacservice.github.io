<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

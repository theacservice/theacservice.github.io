<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to evaluate situation & decided to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, considerate and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>

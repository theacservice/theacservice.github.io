<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>

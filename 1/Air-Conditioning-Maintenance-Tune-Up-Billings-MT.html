<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home.

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This must suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>

<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

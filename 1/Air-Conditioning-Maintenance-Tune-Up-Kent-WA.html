<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Kent Washington</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Lovejoy IL Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require relatively little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system should be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems should be checked at least two times each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

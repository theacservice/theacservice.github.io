<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Powhatan VA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

Either way, if you wish to keep your furnace heating for several years to come, do not forget to keep it serviced and preserved routinely.<p>

<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

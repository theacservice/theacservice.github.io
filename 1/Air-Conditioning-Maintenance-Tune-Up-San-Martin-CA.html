Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to make sure the fans run for an enough period of time.

<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

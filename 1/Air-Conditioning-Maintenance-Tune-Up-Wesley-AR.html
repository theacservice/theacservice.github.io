<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

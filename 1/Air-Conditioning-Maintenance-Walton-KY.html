<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Walton KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

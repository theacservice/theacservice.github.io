For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

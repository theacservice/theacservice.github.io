<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>

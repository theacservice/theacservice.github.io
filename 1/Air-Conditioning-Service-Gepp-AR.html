<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

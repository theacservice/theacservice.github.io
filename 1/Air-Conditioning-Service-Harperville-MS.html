<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- typically two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

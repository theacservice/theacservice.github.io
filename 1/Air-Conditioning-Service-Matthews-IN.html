<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

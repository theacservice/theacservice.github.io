<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12.

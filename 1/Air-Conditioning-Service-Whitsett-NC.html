<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Whitsett NC</h3>
<p>There are many reasons that this can occur. The good news is that you can resolve much of these aspects by yourself without the requirement to call for expert help. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that proceed to examining the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover. You can likewise check the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to ensure it is lit.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

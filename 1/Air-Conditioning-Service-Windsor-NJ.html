<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

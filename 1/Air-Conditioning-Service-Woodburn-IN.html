<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Woodburn IN</h3>
<p>From rewiring old knob-and-tube systems to dealing with furnace and AC setups, the Seattle electricians and plumbing professionals at Seatown have you covered.

As a member of the Bbb with an A+ Score, we take our standing seriously in being a service our loyal customers can depend on.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

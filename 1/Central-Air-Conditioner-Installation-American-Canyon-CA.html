<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

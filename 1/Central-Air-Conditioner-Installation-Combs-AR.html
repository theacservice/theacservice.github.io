<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>

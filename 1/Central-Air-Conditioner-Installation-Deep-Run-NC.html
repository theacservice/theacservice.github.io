<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities.

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that regularly monitors energy usage and temperatures in shops to save money on costs (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate beyond an acceptable variety that could avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Think about an entire house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old adequate to justify replacement.

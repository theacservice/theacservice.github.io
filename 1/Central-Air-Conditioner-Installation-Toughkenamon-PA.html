<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Toughkenamon PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I highly suggest using this service. Extremely dependable incredibly great. Took care of a part that was not covered under guarantee quick and efficient and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Great company begun by a person who is aiming to grow his business and secure his family. He set up a complete system inside and out. Great unit and a very good cost. I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it twice a year with out having to be reminded to do it.<p>

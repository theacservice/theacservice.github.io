<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Van Orin IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

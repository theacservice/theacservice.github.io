We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the issue with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, uncomplicated and a completely pleasurable person to have around that whole time.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently tough to figure out if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is necessary to pay attention to the time and place the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

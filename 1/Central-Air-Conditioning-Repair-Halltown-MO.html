<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

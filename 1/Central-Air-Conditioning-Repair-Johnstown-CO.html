<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Johnstown CO</h3>

Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER).

A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>

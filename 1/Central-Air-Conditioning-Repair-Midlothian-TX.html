<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and harden-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>

<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have actually managed the one repair I required well, and are always on-time and expert. Have been through a couple of companies over the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been great.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>

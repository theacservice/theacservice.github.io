<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and useful, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for remarkable service.

He consisted of these substantial but minor changes in his bid. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summers and for ecological reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or normal home a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

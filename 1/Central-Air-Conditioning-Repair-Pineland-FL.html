<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which leads to a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has conducted. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be true. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is very important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we offer suggestions to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

Molekule, a residential air cleanser start-up, introduced a new product, now for healthcare usage, and got a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Device Clearance.<p>

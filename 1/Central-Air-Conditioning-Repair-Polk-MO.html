The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>

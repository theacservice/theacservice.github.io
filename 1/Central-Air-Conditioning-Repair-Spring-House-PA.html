<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

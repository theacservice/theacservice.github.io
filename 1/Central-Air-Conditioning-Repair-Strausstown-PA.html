<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The most common type of home heating unit in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive alternative, however more recent systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective gas heaters can achieve AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When central air service fails throughout a heat spell, you might have to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll most likely pay a minimum of several hundred for the repair.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was type of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

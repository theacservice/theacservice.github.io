<p>I am changing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>

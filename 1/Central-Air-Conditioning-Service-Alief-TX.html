<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

<p>Rising energy expenses are not the only reason for high expenses. Furnaces frequently lose their effectiveness as they age, particularly if they have not been effectively maintained. As a result your oil or gas furnace might run longer to offer the same quantity of heat. This will trigger your energy expenses to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis could be utilized to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace.

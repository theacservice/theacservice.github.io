<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit.

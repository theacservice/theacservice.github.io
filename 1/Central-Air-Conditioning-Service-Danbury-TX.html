<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

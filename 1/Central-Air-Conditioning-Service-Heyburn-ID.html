<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

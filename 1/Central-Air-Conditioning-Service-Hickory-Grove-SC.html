<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Hickory Grove SC</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>

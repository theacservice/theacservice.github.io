<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

However in order to keep a comfortable indoor environment, you require every element of your cooling system to be working its finest.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

<p>Enhance your services, earn more services revenue, and provide an incredible consumer experience. To ensure the unit you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation price quote to figure out the exact kind of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we don't just replace it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These computations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning unit consists of 2 main parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet unit. Unlike a system that requires a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split a/c depend on a set of pipelines to link the outdoor to the inside air system which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split a/c installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to produce either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease toxins, we suggest installing advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to eliminate the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help control bacteria and natural smells. Most store-bought filters can not eliminate these tiniest of irritants and don't get rid of germs and gases.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

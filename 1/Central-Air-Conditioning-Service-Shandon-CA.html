<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Many AC systems come with a number of unique functions that can even more improve performance and effectiveness. For instance, property owners might wish to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to minimize energy costs much more. Naturally, more functions indicate greater central air expenses.<p>

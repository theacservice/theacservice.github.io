<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather.

The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

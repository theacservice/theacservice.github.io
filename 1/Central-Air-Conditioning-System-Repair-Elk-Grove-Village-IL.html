<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Improper modification, frequently suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>

<h3>Boiler Maintenance at Red Oak TX - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

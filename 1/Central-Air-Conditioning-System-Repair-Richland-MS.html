The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit won't be able to cool your house effectively. These are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account when buying a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>

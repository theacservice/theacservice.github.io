<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

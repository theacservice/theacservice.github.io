<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years back and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Think about prospective effects of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the maker's directions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>

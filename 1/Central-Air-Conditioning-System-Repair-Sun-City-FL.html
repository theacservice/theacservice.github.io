<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler generally happen. In most cases, the belt is poorly lined up or used and requires replacement.

<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Sun City FL</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>If you are thinking about installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system figures out the labor hours included to develop the system. When you think about installation charges upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand brand-new furnace or more.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>

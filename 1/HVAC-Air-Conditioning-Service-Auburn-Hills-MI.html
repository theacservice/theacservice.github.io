<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

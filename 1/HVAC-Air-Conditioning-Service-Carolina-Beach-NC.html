<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.

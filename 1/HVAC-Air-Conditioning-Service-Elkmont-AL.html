<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks.

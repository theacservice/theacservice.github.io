The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

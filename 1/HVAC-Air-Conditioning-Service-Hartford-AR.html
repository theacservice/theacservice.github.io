<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year.

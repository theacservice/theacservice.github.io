What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our options did an outstanding job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each option. The technicians who set up the new system were fast and professional, while taking time to make certain we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>

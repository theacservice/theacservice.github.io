<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

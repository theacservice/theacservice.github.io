<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

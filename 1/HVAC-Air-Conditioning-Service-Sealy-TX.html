<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Rising energy costs are not the only reason for high costs. Heating systems typically lose their performance as they age, specifically if they have actually not been properly maintained. As a result your oil or natural gas furnace might run longer to provide the same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to go up. And, all of the money you pay your energy utility companies every month could be used to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating expenses with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a considerable distinction, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>

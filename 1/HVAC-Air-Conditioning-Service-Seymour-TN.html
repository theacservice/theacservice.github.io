<p>Certain immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often difficult to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is necessary to take note of the time and place the signs happen. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Some health effects might appear quickly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is merely getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Right after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or gotten worse.<p>

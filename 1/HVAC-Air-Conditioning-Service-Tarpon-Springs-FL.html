<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear higher than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>

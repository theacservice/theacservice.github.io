Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

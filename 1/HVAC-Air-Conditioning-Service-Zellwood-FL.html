<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the professionals thought they just didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>

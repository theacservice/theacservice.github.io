<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

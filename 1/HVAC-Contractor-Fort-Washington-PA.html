<p>Aspects that can add to the growth of biological impurities are damp or wet building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem triggered by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively.

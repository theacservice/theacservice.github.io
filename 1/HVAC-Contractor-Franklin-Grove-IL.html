<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Franklin Grove IL?</h3>

After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

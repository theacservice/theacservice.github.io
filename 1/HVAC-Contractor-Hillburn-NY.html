<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

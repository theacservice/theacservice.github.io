<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care items. Germs and infections, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%.

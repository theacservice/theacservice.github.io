<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Mont Belvieu TX</h3>

It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

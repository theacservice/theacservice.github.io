<h3>AC Maintenance in Mountain View CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

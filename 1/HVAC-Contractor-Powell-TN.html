<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down totally. By comparison, replacing a furnace and examining filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

Because the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground, it protects the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heater that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>

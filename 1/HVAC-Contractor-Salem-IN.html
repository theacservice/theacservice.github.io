<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

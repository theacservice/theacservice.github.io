<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has actually determined building products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the threat also originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

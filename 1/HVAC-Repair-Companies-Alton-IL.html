<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, because it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

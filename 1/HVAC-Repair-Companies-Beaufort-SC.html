<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Beaufort SC HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

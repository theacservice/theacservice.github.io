<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives generally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes generally use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

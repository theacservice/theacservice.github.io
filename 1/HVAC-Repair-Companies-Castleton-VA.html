<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

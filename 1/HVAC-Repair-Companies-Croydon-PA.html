<h3>Cheap AC Units in Croydon PA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

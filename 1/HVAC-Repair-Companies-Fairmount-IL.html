<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

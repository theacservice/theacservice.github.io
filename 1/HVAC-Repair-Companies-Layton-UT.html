<p>You're motivating the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators.

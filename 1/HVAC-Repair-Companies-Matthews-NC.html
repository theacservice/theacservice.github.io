<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>

<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Morristown</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

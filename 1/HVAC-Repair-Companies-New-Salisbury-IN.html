<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

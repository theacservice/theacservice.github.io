They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

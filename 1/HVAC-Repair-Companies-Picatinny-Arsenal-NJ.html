Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

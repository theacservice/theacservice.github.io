<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Belfast TN</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>

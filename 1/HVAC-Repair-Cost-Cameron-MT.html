<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.

However, some manufacturers need regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>

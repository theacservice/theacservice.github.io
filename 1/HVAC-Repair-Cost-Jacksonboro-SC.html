Some sources, such as constructing materials, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release pollutants more or less constantly.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside is associated with a greater frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
<p>You could update to the highest effectiveness equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>

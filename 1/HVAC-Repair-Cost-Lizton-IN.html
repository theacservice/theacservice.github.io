For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>

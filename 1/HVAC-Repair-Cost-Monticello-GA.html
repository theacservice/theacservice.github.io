The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body.

EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year.

Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, eye, and nose inflammation.

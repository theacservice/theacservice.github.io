<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>

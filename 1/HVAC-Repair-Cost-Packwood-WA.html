How do I understand. I now work as an expert to verify the so called remedies and issues. 9 out of 10, I check are completely incorrect.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Petaca NM</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

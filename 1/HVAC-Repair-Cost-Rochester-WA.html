<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings, and home items like air fresheners, release pollutants basically constantly. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the home, release pollutants intermittently. These consist of smoking cigarettes, using unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, furnaces, or area heating units, making use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, using paint strippers in remodeling activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after a few of these activities.<p>

<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, houses and schools matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives indoors. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

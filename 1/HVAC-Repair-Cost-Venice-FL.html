The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary considerably from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might need totally different steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>HVAC Company Near Me in Venice FL</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everyone can afford, so many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a cruel, vicious summertime.<p>

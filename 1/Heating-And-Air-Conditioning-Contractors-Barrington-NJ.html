<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>

Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

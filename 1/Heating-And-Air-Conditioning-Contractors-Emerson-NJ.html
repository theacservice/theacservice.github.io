A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully.

The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>

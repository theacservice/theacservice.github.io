<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Estell Manor NJ</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a series of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest discomfort in individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, elderly individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide gas direct exposures.<p>

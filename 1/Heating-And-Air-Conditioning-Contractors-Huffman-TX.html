<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, but lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's guarantee, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any significant repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. Nevertheless, some producers need regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>

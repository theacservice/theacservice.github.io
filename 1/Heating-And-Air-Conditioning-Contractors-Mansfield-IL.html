<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been effectively dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>

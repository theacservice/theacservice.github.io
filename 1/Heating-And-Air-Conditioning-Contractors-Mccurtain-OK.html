<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>

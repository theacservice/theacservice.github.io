<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

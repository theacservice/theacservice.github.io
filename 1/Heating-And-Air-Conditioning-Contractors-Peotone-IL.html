<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

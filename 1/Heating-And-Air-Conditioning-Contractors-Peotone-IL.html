<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific proof has actually suggested that the air within houses and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research shows that individuals invest approximately 90 percent of their time inside your home. Hence, for lots of people, the threats to health might be greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

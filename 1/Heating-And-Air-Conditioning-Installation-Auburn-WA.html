<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and homes matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the ac system will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become blocked with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Similar to most house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can vary extensively based on the size of the house. Many heating systems will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>

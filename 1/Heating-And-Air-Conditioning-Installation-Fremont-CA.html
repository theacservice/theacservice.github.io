And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

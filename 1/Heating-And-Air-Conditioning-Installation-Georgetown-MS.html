<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Georgetown MS</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>

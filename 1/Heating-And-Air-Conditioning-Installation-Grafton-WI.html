<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently tough to measure, as one response stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing cracks and holes.

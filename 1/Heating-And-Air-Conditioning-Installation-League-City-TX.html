<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

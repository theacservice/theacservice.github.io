<p>As with the majority of home improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary extensively based on the size of the home. Most furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners should think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are seldom used due to long-lasting destructive concerns. Essentially all hydronic glowing floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution.

Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

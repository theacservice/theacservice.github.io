<p>Convected heat systems are progressively popular, particularly in the previous quarter-century as technology has advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in reliability and economy.

In an included system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is attained.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects during summers. The best thing to do is making sure that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned thoroughly before cooler seasons begin.

This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>The first air conditioners and fridges utilized combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Berthold ND</h3>

They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power ought to not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%.

However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

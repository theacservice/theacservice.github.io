<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

This must work until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Fairlawn OH</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out until these problems have actually been fixed.<p>

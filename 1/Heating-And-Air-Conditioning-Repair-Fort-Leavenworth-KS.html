<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work.

He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

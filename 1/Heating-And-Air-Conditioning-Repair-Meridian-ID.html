<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's directions, specifically instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>

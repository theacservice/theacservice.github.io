<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future.

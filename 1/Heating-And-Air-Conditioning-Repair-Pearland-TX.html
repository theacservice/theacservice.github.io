Convected heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

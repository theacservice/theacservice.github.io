<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

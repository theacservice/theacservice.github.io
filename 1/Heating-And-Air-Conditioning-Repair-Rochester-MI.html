<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

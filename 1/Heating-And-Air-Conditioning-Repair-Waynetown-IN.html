<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

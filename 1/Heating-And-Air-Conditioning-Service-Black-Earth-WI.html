<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

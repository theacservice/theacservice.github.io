<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Dillsboro Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

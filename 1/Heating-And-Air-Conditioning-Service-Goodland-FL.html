<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioning system are performance-tested to get rid of extreme or uncommon road and weather. Many basic systems break down after simply four hours of severe vibration testing, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more!

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to defrost your cooling equipment. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality issue is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complex concerns-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three techniques below might be appropriate.<p>

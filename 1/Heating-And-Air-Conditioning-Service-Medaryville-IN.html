<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should employ an expert to inspect and repair the unit.<p>

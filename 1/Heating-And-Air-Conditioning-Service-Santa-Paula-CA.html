<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners.

While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<h3>Working of a HVAC System in Vandiver AL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a variety of signs from headaches, d izziness, weak point, queasiness, confusion, and disorientation, to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are sometimes confused with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, babies, senior individuals, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

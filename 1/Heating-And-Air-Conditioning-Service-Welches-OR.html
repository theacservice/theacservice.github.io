<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main issue in over half the office indoor air investigations it has performed. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be real. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is very important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate problems.

In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be familiar with a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

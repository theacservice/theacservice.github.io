<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance.

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

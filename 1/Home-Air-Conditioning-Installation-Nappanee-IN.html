<p>Clean and mop floorings window ledges and chewable surfaces such as cribs with a service of powdered automated dishwashing machine detergent in warm water.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is an extremely common repair. If your furnace is more than ten years old and youâ $ re having actually other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

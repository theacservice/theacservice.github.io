<p>If you remain in the first few years of company, you may choose to keep your service and product line simple for now. But if you are a recognized business in the procedure of modifying your heating and cooling company plan, consider whether you are prepared to include some complementary sales or services, such as plumbing, insulation, duct sealing, indoor air quality evaluation or system efficiency evaluations.<p>
<p>If you have a large house, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

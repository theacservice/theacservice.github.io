<p>Due to the fact that an ac system moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in West End NC</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each space in your home, and if it develops fractures which leakage, they need to be fixed. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse outcomes. Your home will not be effectively cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Setting up new ductwork for the whole house will cost an average of between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly decreases exposure to pollutants during cooking. Inappropriate change, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a new gas stove or range.

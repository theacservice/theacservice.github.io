Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

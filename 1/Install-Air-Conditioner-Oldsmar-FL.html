<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Oldsmar FL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

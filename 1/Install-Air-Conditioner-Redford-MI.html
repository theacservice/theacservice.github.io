<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

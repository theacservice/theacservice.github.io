You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes correctly. A restriction in your drainage pipes causes a water leak. There are several places a blockage can occur. Among the primary locations where blockages start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>

The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, given that the total capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

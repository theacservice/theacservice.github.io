<h3>How To Get Rid of Boiler Issues in Canoga Park CA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Chatsworth IL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>

<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>

<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning strong fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is fairly complex and can vary significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might need completely various steps and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

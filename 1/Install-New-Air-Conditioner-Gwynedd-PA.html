<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Gwynedd PA?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

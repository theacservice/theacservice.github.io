Proceed to another contractor if the one you're considering wishes to figure out the right system for your house entirely on experience. Though highly influenced by where you live, several factors impact the size system required, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of windows and doors; and the orientation of your house to the sun.

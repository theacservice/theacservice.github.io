<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

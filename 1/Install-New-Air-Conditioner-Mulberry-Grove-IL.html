<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Mulberry Grove IL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the ac system before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

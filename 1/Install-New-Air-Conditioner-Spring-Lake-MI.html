<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. Only be concerned if your house is not warming up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must hire a specialist to check and repair the unit.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. In addition, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing fractures and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>

<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>

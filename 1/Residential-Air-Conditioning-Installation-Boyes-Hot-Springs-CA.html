<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated concerns-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques listed below might be proper.<p>

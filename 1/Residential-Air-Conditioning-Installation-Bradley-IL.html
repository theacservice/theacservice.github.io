<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item.

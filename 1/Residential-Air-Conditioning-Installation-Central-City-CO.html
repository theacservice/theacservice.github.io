<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply.

In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat moved heat to other posts in the rooms, consisting of the human residents.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outside metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>

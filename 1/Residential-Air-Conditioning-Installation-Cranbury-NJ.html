<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Cranbury NJ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

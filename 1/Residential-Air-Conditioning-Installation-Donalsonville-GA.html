<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

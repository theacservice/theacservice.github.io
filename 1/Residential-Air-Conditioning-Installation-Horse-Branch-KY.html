<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

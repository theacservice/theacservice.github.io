<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Mendocino</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heater) with the exact same quantity of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

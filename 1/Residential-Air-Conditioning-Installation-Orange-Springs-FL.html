<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>

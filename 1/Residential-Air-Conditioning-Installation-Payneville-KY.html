<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

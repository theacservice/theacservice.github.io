<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open.

If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>

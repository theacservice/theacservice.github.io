<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Timnath Colorado</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems.

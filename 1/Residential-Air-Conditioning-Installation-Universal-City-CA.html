<p>Many people understand that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have substantial, hazardous result. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of toxins may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top 5 ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface of a flooring heats the lower half of the room, enveloping inhabitants in heat at a lower total temperature level-- in some cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating system." Simply put, in-floor heater supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenses.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>

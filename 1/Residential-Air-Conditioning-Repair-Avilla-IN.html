Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven.

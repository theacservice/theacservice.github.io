This is generally used in a 2nd or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>

<p>Since a job such as this is going to need a rather comprehensive quantity of work it is suggested that a property owner demand several estimates from a range of contractors. The very best times of the year to do such a job remain in the months in which houses are not utilizing their heater.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

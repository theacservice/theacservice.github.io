<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside contaminants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>

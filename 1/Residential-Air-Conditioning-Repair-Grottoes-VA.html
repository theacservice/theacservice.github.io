<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, given that it takes into account not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

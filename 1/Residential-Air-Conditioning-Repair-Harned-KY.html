After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

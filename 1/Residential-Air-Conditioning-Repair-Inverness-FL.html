The typical summer temperature level to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the right SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83.

<p>You must always work with a professional to conduct AC repair, for the very same reason that you trust an expert plumbing professional or electrician.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

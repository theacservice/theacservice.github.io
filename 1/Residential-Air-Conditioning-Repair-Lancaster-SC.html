<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>

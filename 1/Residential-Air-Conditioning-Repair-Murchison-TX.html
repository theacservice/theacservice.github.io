Your heater will work hard for you, but like your automobile, doing routine and routine maintenance will keep it running efficiently, prevent problems, and keep your warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

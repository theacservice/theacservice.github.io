This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

A lot of modern-day warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

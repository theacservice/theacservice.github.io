I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

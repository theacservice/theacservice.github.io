<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to defrost your cooling devices. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

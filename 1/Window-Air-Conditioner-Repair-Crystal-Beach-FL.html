<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time.

In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

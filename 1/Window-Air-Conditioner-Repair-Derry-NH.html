<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.)

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they should be placed. Most frequently they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to put the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>

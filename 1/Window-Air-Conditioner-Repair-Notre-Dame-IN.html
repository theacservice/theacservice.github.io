For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, causing cracks and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.. a really beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Payson UT</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>

<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Pilot Point TX</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

The companies were not made aware they belonged to a study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or techniques used.

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

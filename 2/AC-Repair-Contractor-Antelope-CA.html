The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center..

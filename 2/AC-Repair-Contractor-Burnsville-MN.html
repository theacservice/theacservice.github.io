<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

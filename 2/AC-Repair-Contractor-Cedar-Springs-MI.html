<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.

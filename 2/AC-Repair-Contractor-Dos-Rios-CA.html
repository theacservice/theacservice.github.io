<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

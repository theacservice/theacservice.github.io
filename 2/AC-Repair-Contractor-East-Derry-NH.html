<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants.

<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy area recommends that "Air Purification should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the effectiveness of the coils.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure distinctions created by these forces move air-borne pollutants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts however the fan does not. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

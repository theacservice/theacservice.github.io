<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if needed, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In numerous split-system a/c, this indoor cabinet also contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

If your home currently has a furnace but no air conditioner, a split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to install.<p>

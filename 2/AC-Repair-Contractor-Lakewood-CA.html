<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.

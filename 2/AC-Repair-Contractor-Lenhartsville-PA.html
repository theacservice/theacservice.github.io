<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are typically not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>

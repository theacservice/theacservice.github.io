<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

If your technician discovers that your air ducts have considerable mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a musty odor, they might advise duct cleaning This is especially important if someone in your home has asthma, allergic reactions, or other symptoms that may be associated with indoor air contamination.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, especially if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed frequently, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you anticipate it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Checking and changing the air filters is among the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>

Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure to carbon monoxide.

<p>In addition to these weather condition modifications, we've also been the nation's fastest growing city over the last years, including well over 100,000 individuals, or a growth of 18.7 percent according to the Seattle Times In many areas of our nation, a/c is a basic requirement, suggesting the people that move here from out of state are most likely expecting to have air conditioning. Likewise, real estate prices in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as a result, newer homes are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Lots of attics are also being converted to finished bed rooms to add additional area. Spaces in the upper locations of homes are especially prone to getting uneasy and exceptionally hot throughout the summer season, making air conditioning even more required.<p>

However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants.

<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>

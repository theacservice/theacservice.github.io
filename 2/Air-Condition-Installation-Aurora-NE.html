<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

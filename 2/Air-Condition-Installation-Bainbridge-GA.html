The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

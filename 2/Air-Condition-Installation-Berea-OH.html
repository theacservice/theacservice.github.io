<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

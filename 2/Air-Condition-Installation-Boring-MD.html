<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

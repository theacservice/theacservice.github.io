<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits.

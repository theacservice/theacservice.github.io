All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>

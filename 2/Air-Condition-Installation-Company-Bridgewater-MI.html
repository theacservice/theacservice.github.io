A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

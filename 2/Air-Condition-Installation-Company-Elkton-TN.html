<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

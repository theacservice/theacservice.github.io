<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>

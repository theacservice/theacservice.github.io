<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Kelly NC?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

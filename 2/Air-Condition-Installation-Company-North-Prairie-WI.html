<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Trenton MI?</h3>
<p>A split cooling system may cost close to that of a traditional HVAC system but has shown to be an alternative cost reliable choice to homes that do not have ductwork. Used along with other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window ac system, area heating systems, or oil heaters, it can improve the convenience of your home while keeping your monthly energy bill sensible.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

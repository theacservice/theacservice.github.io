<p>To figure out the right size of oil furnace you require for your home, calculate the home's square footage and determine what zone your house is in. Consult the U.S. Energy Info Administration's climate zone map to determine your zone number. Increase the length and width of each space in your home that you heat and accumulate all the rooms together to get your overall square footage.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma.

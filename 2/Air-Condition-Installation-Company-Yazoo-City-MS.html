They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

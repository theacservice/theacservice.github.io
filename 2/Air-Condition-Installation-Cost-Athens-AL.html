Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment and large houses. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Preventive maintenance offers you the peace of mind that your Cooling and Heating systems are working efficiently and effectively. Preventive air conditioning maintenance and heating maintenance service have lots of advantages for your HVAC system, like improved energy performance.

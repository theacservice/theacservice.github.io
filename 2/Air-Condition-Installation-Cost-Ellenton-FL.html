<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Often it's not a major problem, and your system may just need some maintenance work. It is surprising how many people practice preventive maintenance on our cars, for instance, but don't do the same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter. Do not hesitate to ask about our service strategies that consist of preventive maintenance if you wish to stay ahead of any issues with your home or service HVAC system, so you can avoid expensive repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and fridges employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>

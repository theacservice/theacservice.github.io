<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

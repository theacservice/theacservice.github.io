Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same).

And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>

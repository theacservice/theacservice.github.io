<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Pinecliffe CO Home Owners</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

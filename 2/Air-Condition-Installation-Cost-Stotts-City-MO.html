<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>

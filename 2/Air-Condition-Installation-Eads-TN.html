<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>Choosing the right size central air system for your home is really crucial, as is picking either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which puts the condenser outside the fan and the home and coil within. Correct positioning is also vital to make sure consistent and proper cooling. The pros at All Points Heating make sure you make all the best options for your home.<p>

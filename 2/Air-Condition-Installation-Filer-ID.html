<p>The exhaust outlets enable all dangerous gases to escape your property so there's no risky accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can lead to a dangerous build-up and jeopardize your security. The technician will evaluate all of these aspects of your system and check the chimney flue and vent stack also. They will search for signs of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Gillette NJ</h3>

Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>

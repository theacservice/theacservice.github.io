<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<h3>Things to Search for When Hiring an Kipling NC HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofings, and walls. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor contaminants exhaust them from the house.<p>

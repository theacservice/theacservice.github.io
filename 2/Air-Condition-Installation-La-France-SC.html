<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

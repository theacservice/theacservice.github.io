<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in La Grange NC</h3>

We have the experience and resources required to help from the planning stages through to the final installation. We utilize the latest software application to help create your ductwork system and utilize the greatest quality products in the building and construction and installation.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

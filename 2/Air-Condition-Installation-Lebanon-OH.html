<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Lebanon OH</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a company or merchant to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or hire a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system. A voided warranty will not do you any good must the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and employ a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>

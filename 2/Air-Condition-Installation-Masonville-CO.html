<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<h3>Facts All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Masonville CO</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the needed electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

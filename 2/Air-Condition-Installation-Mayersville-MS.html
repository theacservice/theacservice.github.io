These professionals may also be associated with teaming up with sales and engineering departments to develop items that respond to client needs and market opportunities.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like a space heater) with the same quantity of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>A specific a/c that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the space because its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>

Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness inside is related to a higher prevalence of occupant breathing problems.<p>

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

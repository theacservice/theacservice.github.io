<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Support! Environment Pro is reputable and genuinely appreciated us and our circumstance. We got back one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could search for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. There are several design approaches in use today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person must be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be professionally checked and adjusted before the start of every cooling season. However, don't let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak performance.<p>

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of infected soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>

We'll visit your house for a thorough evaluation, including an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to discover the very best system for your home.

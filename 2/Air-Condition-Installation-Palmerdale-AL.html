<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the result of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Office temperature levels should be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air flow need to be prevented.<p>

The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next step is to defrost your cooling equipment. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

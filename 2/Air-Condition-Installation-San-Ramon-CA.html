<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For San Ramon CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

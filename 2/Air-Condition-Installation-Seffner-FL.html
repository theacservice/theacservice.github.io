<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

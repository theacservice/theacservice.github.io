<p>The majority of people do not understand how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining correctly. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leakage. There are many different locations a blockage can take place. One of the primary areas where obstructions start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

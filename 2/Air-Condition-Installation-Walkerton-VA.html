<p>When trying to figure out how often I should replace my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into consideration.

It takes about six months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one air conditioning filter need replacing more frequently.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>

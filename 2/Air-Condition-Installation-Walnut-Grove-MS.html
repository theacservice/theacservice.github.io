<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Walnut Grove MS</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>We look at hints before we supply advice to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are many actions a property owner can require to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are pointed out here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing solid wood products. Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

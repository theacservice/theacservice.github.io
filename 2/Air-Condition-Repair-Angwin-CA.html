<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Angwin CA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an a/c moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>As with homes, the most crucial aspect influencing indoor air quality is the existence of pollutant sources. Frequently found workplace toxins and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure supplies; formaldehyde from pushed wood items; other organics from developing products, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning activities and products, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and printing shop; biological contaminants from unclean ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your vehicle.

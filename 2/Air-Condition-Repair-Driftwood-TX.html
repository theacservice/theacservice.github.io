<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a very useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>

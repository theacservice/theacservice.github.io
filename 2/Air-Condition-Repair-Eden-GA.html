Thus, for many people, the dangers to health may be greater due to exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>

Depending on the site and bug to be controlled, one or more of the following steps can be effective: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making sure that wood structure materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by keeping fire wood away from the house.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>

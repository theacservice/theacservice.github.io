<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor.

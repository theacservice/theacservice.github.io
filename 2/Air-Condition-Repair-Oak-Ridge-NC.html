<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to preserve and comprehend.<p>

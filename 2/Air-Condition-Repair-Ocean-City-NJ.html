<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>

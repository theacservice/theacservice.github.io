<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>

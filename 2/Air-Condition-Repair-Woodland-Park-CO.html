Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand.

He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

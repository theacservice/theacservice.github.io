<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly decreases exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a brand-new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

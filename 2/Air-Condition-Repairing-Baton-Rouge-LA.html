<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Baton Rouge LA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

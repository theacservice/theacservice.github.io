<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heating systems that kick on often might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

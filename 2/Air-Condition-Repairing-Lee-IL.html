<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same.

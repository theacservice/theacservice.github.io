<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

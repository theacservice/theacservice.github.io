<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

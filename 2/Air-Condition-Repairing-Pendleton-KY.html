<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>

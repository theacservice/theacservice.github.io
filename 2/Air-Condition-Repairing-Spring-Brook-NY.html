<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Spring Brook NY</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might set off attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some people can establish a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has likewise been shown to cause cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the start. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

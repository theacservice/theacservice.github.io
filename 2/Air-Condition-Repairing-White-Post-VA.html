<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and infants are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

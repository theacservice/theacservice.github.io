<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning On Your Brookshire TX Home</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. If the specific parts are in proper order, the technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

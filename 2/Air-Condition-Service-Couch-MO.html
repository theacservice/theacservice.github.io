Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

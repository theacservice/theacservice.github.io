<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>. Before picking the installation location of ac system, several main aspects need to be thought about. First off, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area.

The outdoor unit should likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop greatly.

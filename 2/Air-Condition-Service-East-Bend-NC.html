<p>The installation was quick, professional and extremely well done. The installers were polite and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly people who are good at what they do.

Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most units come with a package that consists of adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will guarantee a secure and airtight  fit in the window opening.

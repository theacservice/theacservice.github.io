The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Elizabeth AR</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has recognized building materials, furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, however much of the danger also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at maximum efficiency and might get too hot.

It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work harder and may overheat if the system is too little.

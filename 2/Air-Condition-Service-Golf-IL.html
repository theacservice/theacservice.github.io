If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater.

<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

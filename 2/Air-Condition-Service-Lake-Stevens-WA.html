<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs.

<p>These men have actually been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I sometimes need contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home may cost.

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

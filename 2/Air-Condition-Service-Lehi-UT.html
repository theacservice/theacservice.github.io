<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

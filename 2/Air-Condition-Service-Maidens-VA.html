<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any offered opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>

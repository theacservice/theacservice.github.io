<p>Filters can get dirty easily, especially if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>

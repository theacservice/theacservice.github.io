Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure began.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling.

Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out up until these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.

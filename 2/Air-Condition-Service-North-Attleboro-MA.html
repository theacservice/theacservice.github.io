<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a couple of years back.<p>

<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if needed, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>Glowing heater don't use ducts, which makes them quite a bit more energy efficient than other systems. They also do not produce cold and hot spots.

<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs.

They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

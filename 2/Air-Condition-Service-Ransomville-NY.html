<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is created for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Our professionals discuss all of your options prior to beginning the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you.

<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

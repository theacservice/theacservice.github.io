To make sure the unit you choose is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation estimate to figure out the precise type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply replace it with the very same size unit you currently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

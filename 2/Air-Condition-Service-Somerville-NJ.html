<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if essential, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course. A basic ac system transfers heat out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>

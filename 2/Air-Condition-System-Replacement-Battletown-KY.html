<p>We required 2 check outs - Jake came out first and was very knowledgeable and enjoyable and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later on and was great and also educated to talk with. They both did a great job. Sabre's office personnel is really useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Absolutely recommend.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, expert and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and acknowledge quickly people who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss information that develops a task very well done. I really extremely suggest the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>

If the current system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense also.<p>

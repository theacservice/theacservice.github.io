<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

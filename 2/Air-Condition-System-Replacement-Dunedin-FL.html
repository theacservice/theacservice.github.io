<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipes are rarely used due to long-lasting corrosive concerns. Practically all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>

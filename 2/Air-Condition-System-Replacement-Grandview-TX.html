<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>

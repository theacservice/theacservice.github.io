<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Place control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or perhaps moving susceptible residents.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many people assume contamination is just an outside issue, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

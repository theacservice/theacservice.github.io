<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Place control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or perhaps moving susceptible residents.<p>
<p>We're investing a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many people assume contamination is just an outside issue, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't believe adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

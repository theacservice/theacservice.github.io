<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

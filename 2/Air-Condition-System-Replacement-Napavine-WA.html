<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer must check measurements of humidity, air and temperature circulation. In addition, examination and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for developing use and tenancy) need to be carried out. A building walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be helpful. Leakages need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungis or bacteria and require to be eliminated, also. In some circumstances, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

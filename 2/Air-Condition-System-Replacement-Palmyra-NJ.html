Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

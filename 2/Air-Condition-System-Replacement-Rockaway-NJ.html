<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Rockaway NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater.

We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

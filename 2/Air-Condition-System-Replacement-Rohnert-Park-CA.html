An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

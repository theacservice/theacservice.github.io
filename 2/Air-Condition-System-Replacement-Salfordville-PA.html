<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

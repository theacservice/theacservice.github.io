<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are many other toxins that can not only unclean up the air, however result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural compounds) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building residents may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

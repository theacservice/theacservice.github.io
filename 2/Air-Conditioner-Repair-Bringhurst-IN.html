Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour.

<h3>AC Technician in Elk CA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the trouble area in examining the expense. He fixed the issue in one day, had actually changed the expense to what I thought about reasonable before he called back, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a plan to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually utilized them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>Some people call him choosy, but to us, it simply makes great sense. You wish to welcome courteous and tidy service professionals into your house. Our service technicians have access to shower stations and fresh uniforms at locations throughout the city, so they'll never track dirt from their last job into your house. They constantly slip hygienic covers over their shoes to safeguard your carpets too. Just one in every 35 prospects gets to join our group, so you understand you're working with the very best convenience consultants in the location.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they concern carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>

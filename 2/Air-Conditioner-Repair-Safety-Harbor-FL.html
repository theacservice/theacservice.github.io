<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Safety Harbor FL</h3>
<p>Most people don't understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC system is not draining effectively. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leakage. There are several places a clog can take place. One of the main areas where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is improperly lined up or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Ac system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>

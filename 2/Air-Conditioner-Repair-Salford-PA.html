All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

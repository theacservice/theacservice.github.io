Given that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very daunting in the beginning, requiring specialized tools, devices, and knowledge. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to stress over a thing.<p>

AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

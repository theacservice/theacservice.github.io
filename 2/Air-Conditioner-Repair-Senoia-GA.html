<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

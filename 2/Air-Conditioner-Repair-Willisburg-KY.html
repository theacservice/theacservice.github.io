<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>

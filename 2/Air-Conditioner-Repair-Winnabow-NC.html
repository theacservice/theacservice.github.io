<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, since it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A/c manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers.

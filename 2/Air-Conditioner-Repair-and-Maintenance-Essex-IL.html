PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>

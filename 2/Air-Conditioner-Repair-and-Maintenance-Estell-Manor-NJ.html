<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Local building codes most likely define the amount (and often quality) of outdoor air that ought to be constantly supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).

<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they must be put. Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area.

<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>

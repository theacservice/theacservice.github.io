<p>There are a couple of main things that property owners will wish to take into account when deciding which of the very best AC systems they should set up in their homes. It actually depends on what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

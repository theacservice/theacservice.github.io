Such aspects include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

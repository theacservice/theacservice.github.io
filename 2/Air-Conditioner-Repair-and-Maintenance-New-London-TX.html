What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

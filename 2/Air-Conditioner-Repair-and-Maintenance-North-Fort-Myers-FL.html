<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate.

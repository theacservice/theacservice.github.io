<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.)

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Since it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you know it remains in your house.

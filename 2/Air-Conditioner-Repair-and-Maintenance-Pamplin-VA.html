<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- usually two to four weeks.

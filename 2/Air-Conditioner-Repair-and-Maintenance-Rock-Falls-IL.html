<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental costs. It protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins because the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground.

While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>

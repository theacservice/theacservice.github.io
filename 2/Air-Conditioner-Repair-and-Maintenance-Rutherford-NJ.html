<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Rutherford NJ?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

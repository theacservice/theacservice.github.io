<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>

Any disturbance or disruption in the circulation of electricity makes the system unusable. This is one of the downsides to installing an electric radiant heat system. However, presuming they are installed correctly and correctly looked after, the probability of them having problems is small.<p>

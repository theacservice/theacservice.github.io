<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

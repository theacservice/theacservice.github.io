<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Westport KY</h3>
<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

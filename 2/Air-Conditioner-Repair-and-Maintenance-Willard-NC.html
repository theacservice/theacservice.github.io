<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

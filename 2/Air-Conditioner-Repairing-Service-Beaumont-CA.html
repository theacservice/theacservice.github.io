<p>A/c can create a lot of water due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

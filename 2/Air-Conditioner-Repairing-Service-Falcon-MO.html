<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>

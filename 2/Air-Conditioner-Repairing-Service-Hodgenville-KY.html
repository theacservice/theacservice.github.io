As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

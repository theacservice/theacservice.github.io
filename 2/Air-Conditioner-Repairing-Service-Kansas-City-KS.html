<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction specified the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still warms to the best temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should employ a professional to examine and repair the system.<p>

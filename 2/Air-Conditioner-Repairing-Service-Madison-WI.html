<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

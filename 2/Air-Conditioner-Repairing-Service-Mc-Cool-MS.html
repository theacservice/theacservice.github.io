<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical power, a heatpump is an affordable option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges employed flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and constructing safety at reasonable energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for a/c.

<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>

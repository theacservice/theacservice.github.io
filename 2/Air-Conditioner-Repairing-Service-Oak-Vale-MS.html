<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>

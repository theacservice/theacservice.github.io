<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

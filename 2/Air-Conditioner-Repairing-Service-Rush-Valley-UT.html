<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up.

<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Switch off the power.

Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

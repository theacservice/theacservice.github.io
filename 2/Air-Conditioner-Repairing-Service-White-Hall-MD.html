<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in White Hall MD</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

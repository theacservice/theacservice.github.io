<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

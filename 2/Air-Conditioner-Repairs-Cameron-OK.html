Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and then change it ON.

You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one reaction stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. a really useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>

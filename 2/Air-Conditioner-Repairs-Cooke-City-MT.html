Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them till they have actually been properly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

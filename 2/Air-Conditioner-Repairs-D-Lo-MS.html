<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

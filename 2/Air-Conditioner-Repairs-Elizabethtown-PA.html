<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up.

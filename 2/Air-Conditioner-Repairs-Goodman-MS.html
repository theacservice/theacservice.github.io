<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the problem location in looking over the costs. He resolved the concern in one day, had changed the costs to what I thought about fair before he recalled, understood what may have caused the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>

Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a harsh, harsh summertime.<p>

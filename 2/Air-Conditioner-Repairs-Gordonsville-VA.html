<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

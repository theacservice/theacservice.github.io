<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>

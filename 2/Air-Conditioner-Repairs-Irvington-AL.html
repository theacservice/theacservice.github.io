<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore needs conditions appropriate for both organisms.

<p>Because they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Since the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was initially driven by increasing energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually enforced tighter constraints over the years. There are numerous techniques for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>

Senseware, a smart structure start-up known for air quality tracking, released a solution bundle in collaboration with other suppliers to help clients safely reopen their organisations.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

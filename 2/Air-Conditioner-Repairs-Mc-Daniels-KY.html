Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

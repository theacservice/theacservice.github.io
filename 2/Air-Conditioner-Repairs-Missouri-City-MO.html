<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>During typical furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can build up on internal elements.

Left uncontrolled, these issues can cause loss of efficiency and worse, breakdown of component materials and a much shorter furnace lifespan Over time, important components like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start wearing away, leading to reduced efficiency.<p>
<p>More often, however, private investigators will need to come to the structure to carry out individual interviews with residents, to try to find possible sources of the issues, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other building functions. Since taking measurements of toxins at the extremely low levels typically found in office complex is pricey and might not yield information easily useful in determining issue sources, private investigators might not take numerous measurements.

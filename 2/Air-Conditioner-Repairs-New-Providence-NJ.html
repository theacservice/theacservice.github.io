<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in New Providence NJ</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.

<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

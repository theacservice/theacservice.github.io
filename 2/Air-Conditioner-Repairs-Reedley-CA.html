<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just radiant systems.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>

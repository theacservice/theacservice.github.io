<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>

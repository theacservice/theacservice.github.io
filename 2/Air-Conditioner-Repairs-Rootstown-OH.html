<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Rootstown OH</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have substantial, damaging effect. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of contaminants may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air contamination among the leading five ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

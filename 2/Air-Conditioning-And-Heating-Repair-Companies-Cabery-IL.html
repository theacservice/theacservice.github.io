<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years.

<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in numerous countless asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation.

<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location.

The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the result of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>

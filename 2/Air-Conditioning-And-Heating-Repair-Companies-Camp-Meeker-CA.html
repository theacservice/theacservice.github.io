<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in Camp Meeker CA?</h3>
<p>We have actually been helping keep our consumers all over the Tacoma & Puget Sound area warm for several years. Our team of extremely competent professionals knows the ins and outs of every style and model of heating system on the market.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

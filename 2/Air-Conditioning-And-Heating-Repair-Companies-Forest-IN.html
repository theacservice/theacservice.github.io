The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.

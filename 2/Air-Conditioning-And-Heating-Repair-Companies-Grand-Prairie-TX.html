<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

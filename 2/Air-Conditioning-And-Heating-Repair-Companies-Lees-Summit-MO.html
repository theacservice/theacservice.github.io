At Horizon Services, we have been assisting property owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their homes' heating systems when their old ones are no longer functional.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

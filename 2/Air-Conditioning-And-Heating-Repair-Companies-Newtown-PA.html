<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, workplaces and schools matters, especially considering that we invest most of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>If you operate in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you might unknowingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil really near homes may be infected from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by roads and highways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before entering the home. Change your clothing prior to you go home and wash these clothing separately if you work with lead in your task or a hobby. Encourage your kids to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your kids from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come within.<p>

<p>Prior to cooling or installing any new heating system in a house, it is essential to re evaluate and lower the energy load of the home. A more energy effective house will not just decrease the cost of a new system and energy expenses, however it will significantly improve the convenience of your house. Prior to we design and install any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Standard enhancements normally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest a number of qualified house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for references.<p>

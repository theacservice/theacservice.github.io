<p>The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the skills or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels.

<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces at once, but are not very energy effective.

At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>

<p>IÃ¢ $ m really particular with my things. I like my devices and devices initial, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

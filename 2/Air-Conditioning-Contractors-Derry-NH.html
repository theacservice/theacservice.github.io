In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered.

A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

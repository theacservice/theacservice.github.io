<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>

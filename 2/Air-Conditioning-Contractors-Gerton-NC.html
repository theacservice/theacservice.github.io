<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce pollutants, we suggest installing advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to get rid of the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also help control germs and natural smells. Many store-bought filters can not get rid of these tiniest of allergens and don't eliminate germs and gases.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

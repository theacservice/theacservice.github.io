<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

<h3>Ventilation System in Greentown Ohio</h3>
<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air might likewise be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

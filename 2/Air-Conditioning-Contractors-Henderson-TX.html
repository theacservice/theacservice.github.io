<p>There's a big distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common form of home heating-- convection. Over the previous century, the majority of houses in colder climates were heated up by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floorings heated. In turn, the objects in the space, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

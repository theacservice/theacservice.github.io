The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource section recommends that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.

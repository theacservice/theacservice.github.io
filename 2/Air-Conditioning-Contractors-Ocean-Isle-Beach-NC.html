<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Would recommend them anytime.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work.

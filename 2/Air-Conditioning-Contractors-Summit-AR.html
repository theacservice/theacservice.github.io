<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other areas.<p>

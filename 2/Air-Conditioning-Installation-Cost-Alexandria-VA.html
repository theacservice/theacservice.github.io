<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently.

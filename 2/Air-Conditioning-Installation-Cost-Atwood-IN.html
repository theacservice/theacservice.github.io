<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

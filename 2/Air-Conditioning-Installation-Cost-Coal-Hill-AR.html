<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning unit moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy.

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Comfort</h2>

<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>

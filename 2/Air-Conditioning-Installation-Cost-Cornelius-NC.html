<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same).

The effects of CO exposure can vary greatly from person to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings.

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The primary danger of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic homes is the capability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a severe breathing disease.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint products, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene direct exposure include removing cigarette smoking within the house, attending to optimum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint materials and unique fuels that will not be utilized immediately.<p>

Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>

<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Montvale NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

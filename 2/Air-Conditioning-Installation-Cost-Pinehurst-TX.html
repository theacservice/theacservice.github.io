<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately.

The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit.

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however homeowners lack the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>

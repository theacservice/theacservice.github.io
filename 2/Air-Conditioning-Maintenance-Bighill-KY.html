<p>Immediate impacts might show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is merely removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear right after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of illness brought on by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>

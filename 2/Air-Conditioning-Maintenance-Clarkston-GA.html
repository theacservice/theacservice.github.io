<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>When deciding which of the finest AC units they must install in their houses, there are a few main things that homeowners will desire to take into factor to consider. It really depends on what you value the most in a top brand name central air conditioner. The major aspects for most house owners will be the total cost to install the very best air conditioner brand names, lifespan of the AC unit, service warranties used, energy efficiency (SEER rankings), and size of the system you require for your house's square video footage (HEAPS) to effectively cool your home.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be smarter to replace the whole system.<p>

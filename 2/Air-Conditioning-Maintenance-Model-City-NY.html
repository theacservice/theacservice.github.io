<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Sometimes it's not a significant issue, and your system might merely require some maintenance work. It is unexpected how many people practice preventive maintenance on our cars, for example, but do not do the exact same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter season. Do not hesitate to inquire about our service strategies that consist of preventive maintenance if you want to remain ahead of any problems with your house or company HVAC system, so you can avoid costly repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and fridges used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

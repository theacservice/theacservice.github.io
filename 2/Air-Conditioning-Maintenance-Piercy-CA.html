<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

You may also choose to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather condition authorizations.<p>

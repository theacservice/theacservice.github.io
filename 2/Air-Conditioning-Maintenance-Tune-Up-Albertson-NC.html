<h3>Home AC Repair in Albertson NC</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

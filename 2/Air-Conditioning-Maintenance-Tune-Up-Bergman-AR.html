<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study discovered. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>

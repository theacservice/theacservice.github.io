<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your home is located, the local area's climate can alter considerably. A home situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your home due to heat Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would require a much bigger heating capacity too which will impact costs. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement costs by LOADS.<p>

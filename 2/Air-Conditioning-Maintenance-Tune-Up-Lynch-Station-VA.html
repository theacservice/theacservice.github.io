<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this information might determine potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>

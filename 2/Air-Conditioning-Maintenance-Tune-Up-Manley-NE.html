<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

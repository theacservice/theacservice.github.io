Building-Related Illness (BRI) describes less frequent (but often more serious) cases of people ending up being ill after remaining in a particular building at a certain time.

<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will decrease benzene direct exposure consist of getting rid of smoking cigarettes within the house, attending to optimum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint materials and unique fuels that will not be used right away.<p>
<p>Outside impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Rogersville AL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, walls, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

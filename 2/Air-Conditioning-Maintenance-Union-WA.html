<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Wallsburg UT</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year.

Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they identified the issue and repaired really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

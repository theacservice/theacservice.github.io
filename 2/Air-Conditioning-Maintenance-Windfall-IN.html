<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Windfall IN?</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as various as the different houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the kind of house HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is running safely and not contributing to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building products, furnishings, and household products like air fresheners, release toxins more or less constantly.

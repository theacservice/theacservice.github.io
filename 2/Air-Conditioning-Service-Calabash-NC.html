<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

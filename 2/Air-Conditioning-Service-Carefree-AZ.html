The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

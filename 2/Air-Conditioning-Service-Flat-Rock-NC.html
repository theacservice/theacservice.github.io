<h3>House Ventilation in Flat Rock NC</h3>
<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to examine building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas techniques used predominantly in developing research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by constructing operators. NIST researchers are continuously developing new test procedures, and then showing them in the field to evaluate their expediency and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has resulted in the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in numerous thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, nose, and throat irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>A third method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your home may not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To detect odors in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>

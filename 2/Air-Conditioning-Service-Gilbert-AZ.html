Buildings constantly progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For instance, we might see a window as altering somewhat in time as it ends up being unclean, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.

CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

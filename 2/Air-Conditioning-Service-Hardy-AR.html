I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>

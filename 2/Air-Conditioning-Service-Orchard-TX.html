<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>

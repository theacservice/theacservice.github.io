The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank must be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed regularly to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water locations).

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

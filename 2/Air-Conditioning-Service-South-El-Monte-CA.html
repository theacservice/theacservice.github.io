<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production combines quality items and outstanding service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating and cooling products around the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several spaces with one external unit. In the outside system of this air conditioning unit there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems located in the space.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

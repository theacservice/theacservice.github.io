<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>

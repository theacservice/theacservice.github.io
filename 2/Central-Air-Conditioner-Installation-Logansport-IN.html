<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up impact your comfort, they can also result in duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

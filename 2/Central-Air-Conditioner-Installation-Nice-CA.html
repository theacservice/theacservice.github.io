<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Nice CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

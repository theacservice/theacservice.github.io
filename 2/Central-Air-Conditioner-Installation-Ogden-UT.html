Because ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem very challenging in the beginning, requiring specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to worry about a thing.<p>

<p>Sean was really helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that add to indoor air pollution.

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

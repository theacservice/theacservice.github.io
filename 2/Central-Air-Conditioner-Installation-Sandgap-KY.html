<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer guidance to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>

If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar makers may decline warranty protection.<p>

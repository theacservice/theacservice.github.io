<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

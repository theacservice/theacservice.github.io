<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Work environment temperature levels ought to be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by excessive air flow should be prevented.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Due to the fact that they only partly remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the quantity of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides more info on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature level throughout the year.

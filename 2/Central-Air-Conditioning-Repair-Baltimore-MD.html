<p>Heating systems resemble cars and trucks. As they age, you can change one part only need another part replaced or repaired next year. It does not take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

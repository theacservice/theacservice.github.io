<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Bowling Green</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Bowling Green SC?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

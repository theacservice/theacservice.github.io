<h3>The Way to Select a Specialist HVAC Tech in Clinton NC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a qualified representative from a business or seller to do the installation. If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the cooling system. A voided warranty will not do you any good must the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the start and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>

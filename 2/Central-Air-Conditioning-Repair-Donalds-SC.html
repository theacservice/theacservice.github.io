In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>If you observe a decline in heat output, first ensure the air filter is tidy and in good condition. Next, examine other components of the furnace for any accumulation of particles, dust and dirt, an economical repair that can help increase performance.

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done.

I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Fair Bluff NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

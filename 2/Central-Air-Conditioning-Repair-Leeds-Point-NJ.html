<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>

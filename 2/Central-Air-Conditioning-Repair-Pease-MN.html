<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..

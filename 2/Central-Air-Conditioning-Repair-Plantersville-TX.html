<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

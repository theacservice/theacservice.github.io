<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Signal Hill CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

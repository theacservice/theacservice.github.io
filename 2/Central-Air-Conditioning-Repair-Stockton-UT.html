<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

Heaters that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

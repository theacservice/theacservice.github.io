<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can imply considerable cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

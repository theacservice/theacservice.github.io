<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

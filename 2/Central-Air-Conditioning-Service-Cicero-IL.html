Their techs are extremely knowledgeable and professional. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was certainly affordable, I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>

When the temperature level falls listed below a limit, both the fan and compressor are turned off to mitigate further temperature drops; explanation required this avoids moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation needed When the temperature level increases once again, clarification required the compressor reboots and the fan returns to low speed.<p>

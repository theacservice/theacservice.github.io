<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.

<p>The primary health result related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>

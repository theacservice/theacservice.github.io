<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

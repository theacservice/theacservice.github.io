<h3>Home AC Repair in White Mills KY</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

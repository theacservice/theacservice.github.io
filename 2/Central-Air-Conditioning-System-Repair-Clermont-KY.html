<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>

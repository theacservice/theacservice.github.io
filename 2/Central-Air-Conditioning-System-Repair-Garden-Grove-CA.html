<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the harmful impacts of lead.

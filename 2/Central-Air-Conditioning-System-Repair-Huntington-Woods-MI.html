<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Huntington Woods MI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

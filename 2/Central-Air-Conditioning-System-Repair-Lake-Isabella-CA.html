The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>You ought to get your HVAC system visually examined at least when every year to make sure all the systems are working well. This assessment is an important element of HVAC maintenance. You won't observe a problem up until it stops working in the middle of winter if you don't get your system checked. Due to the fact that you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is repaired, that's the last thing you want. Regular evaluation and maintenance likewise helps keep it in excellent shape and prolongs its life.<p>

(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

If you buy a brand-new gas stove or variety, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

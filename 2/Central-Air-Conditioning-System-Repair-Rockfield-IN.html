<p>Central air units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

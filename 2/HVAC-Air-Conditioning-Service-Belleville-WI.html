<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure materials used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

Improperly situated outdoor air consumption vents can also generate air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation paired with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>

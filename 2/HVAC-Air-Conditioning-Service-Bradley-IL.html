<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem.

The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

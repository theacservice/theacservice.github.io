We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>

Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>

If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>Even newer furnaces less than five years of ages have actually been found as bad. A lot of homeowners are stunned to discover that their 'new' furnace  heat exchanger.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

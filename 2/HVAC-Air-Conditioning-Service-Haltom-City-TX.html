However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to contact an expert to repair the system and examine.<p>
<h3>Central Heating Systems in Haltom City Texas</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Make certain there are no rugs, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers impact your convenience, they can also cause duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. Another element of the job is encouraging clients regarding how to avoid future issues and properly maintain devices by, for example, routinely oiling parts or altering filters. Simply put, the HVAC technician has three goals: Avoid issues. Conserve cash. Stay comfortable. These technicians might likewise be associated with working together with sales and engineering departments to establish products that respond to customer needs and market opportunities.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

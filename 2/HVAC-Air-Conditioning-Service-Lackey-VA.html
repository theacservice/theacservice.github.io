<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside is associated with a higher frequency of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>A/c unit can create a lot of water since they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

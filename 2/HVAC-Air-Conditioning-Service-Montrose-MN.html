<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.

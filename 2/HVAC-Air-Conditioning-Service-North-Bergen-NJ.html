<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>

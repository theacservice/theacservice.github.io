<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Place control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants and even relocating susceptible occupants.<p>

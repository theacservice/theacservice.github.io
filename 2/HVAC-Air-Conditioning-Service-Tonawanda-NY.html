<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>

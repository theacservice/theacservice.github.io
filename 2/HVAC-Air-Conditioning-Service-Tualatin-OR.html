<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your house heating unit. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to greater energy costs. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long run. Prices for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs approximately $12,500 for high-efficiency designs. Electric heating systems start at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a vicious, terrible summer.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimum performance and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy bills to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not big enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will need to work more difficult and might overheat. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>

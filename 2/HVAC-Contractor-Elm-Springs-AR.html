<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is permitted to increase and stream out high building openings to the outdoors (stack effect ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, but care must be required to ensure convenience. In humid or warm climates, keeping thermal convenience entirely via natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers likewise use outdoors air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when appropriate.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from.

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

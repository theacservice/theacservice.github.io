<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Fort Mill SC Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some human beings exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been shown to trigger cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

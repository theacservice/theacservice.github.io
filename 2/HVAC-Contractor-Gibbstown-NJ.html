<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Gibbstown NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

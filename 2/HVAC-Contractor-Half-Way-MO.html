<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

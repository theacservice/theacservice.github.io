<p>Many people underestimate the extent of the indoor air pollution issue. Air pollution is generally visualized as the black smoke emitted from factories.

<p>For contaminants aside from radon, measurements are most suitable when there are either health symptoms or indications of poor ventilation and specific sources or toxins have actually been determined as possible causes of indoor air quality issues.

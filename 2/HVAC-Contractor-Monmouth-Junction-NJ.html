<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

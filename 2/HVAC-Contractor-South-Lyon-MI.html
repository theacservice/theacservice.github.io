<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in South Lyon MI</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

The bright side is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>

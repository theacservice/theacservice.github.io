<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in South Lyon MI</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

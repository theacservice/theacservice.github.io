Soil by highways and roadways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to entering the house. If you deal with lead in your task or a pastime, change your clothes prior to you go home and wash these clothing independently.

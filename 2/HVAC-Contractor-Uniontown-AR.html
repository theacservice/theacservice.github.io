I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

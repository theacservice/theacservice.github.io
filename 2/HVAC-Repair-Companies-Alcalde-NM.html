<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Alcalde NM</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner.

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

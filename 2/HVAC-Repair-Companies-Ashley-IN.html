<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom.

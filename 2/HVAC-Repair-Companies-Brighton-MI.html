<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

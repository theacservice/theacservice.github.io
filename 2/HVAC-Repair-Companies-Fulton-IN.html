<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

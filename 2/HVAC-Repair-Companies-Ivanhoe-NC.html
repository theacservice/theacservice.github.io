<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>

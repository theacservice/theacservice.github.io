<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Laceys Spring AL?</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

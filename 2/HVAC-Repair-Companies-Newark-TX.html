However, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

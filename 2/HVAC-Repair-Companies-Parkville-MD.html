<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>

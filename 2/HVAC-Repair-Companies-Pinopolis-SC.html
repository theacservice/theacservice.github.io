<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological impurity. Biological pollutants in the home might consist of mold, germs, infections, termites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be distributed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause transmittable diseases such as Legionnaires' disease. They also can cause allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Symptoms brought on by biological toxins include sneezing, eye irritation, coughing, dizziness, and respiratory infections.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is enabled to stream and increase out high building openings to the outside (stack impact ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize extremely little energy, but care needs to be taken to guarantee convenience. In damp or warm environments, preserving thermal comfort entirely by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers likewise use outside air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>

<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Pinopolis SC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

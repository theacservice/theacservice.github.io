<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

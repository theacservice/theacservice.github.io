What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a house, it is required to re minimize the energy and evaluate load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not just minimize the cost of a brand-new system and utility bills, but it will greatly enhance the comfort of your home. Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental enhancements normally include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest numerous certified home Energy Star auditors and installation experts. Please Contact United States for references.<p>

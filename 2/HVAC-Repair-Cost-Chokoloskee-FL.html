<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area.

These charges will be included in the installation expenses.<p>

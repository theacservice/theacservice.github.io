<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

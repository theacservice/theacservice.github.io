<p>The most common kind of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey alternative, but newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems typically accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely efficient gas heating systems can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>

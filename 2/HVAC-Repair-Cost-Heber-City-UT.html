<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning unit isn't old adequate to validate replacement, think about a whole house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for higher comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>

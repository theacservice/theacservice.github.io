In some instances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to help set up or repair cooling and heating unit.

<p>You might upgrade to the greatest efficiency gear offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air system.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>

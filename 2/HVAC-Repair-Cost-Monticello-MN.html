<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

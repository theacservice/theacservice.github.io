<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.

Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest pain.

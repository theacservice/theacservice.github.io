<h3>Commercial HVAC in Sawyer ND</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

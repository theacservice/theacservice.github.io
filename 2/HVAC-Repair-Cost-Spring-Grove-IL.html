The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

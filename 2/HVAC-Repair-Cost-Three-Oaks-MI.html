<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

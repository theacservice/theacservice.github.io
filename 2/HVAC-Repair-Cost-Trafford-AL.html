Combustion items from automobile exhaust, furnaces, water heaters, space heating units, scented candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.

As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

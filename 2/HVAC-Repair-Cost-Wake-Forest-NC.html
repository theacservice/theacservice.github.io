<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. You can prevent all these issues by ensuring that your system is inspected frequently, as this will avoid even small repairs from ending up being big issues.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

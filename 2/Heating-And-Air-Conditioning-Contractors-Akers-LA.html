Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level.

<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Many AC units include a number of unique features that can further improve performance and effectiveness. For example, property owners may wish to look for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular feature to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to lower energy expenses even more. Of course, more features imply greater central air conditioning expenses.<p>

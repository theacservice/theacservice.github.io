<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

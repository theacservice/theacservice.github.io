<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>

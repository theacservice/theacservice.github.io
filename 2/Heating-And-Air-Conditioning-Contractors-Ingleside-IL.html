<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers during summertimes.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature level.

However, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to call in a professional to check and repair the unit.<p>

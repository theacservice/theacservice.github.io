<h3>HVAC Installation Near Me in Islandton South Carolina</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

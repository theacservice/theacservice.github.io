<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heating system over a traditional forced air heater. Radiant heating systems tend to be far more energy effective than other heating units, for one thing. Forced air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Required air heating systems likewise tend to produce hot and cold spots throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing product purchased with your house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes. During the inspection on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new home owner I have actually learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

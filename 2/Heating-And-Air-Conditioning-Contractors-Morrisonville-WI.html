<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>

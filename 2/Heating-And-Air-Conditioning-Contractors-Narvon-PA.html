<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the spaces dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>During regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, wetness from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can build up on internal elements. Airborne aspects from typical household items and surfaces can cause formicary corrosion within your HVAC devices. Left untreated, these concerns can result in loss of effectiveness and worse, breakdown of component materials and a much shorter furnace life-span With time, essential elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower real estate can begin corroding, resulting in minimized efficiency.<p>

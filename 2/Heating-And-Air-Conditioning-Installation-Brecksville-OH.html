<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature level. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>

Just be concerned if your home is not heating up. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must contact a specialist to repair the unit and check.<p>

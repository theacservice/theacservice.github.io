<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

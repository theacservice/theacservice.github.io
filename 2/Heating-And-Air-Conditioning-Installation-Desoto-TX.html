<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Fort Bragg NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

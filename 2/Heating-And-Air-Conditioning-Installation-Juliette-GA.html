<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the service technicians believed they just didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

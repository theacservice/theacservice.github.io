<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very thorough in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered terrific client service at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>To start, it's a good idea to think about energy performance. By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of an effectiveness rating as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Efficiency ratings must be identified with all units. While effective systems may cost more, going with an Energy Star-rated device is an excellent way to delight in additional comfort.<p>

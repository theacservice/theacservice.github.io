<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial buildings can not be successfully determined or remedied without a thorough building examination. These investigations might begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building investigators evaluate the history of occupant signs and building operation treatments. In some cases, these questions may rapidly uncover the issue and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

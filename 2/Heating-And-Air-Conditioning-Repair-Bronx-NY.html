<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one reaction stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented.

For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>

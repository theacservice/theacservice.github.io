Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>

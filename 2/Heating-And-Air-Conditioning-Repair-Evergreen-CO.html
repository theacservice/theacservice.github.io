<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has suggested that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research shows that people invest approximately 90 percent of their time inside. Hence, for many individuals, the dangers to health may be higher due to exposure to air contamination inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>These guys have been great. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these people twice.

Integrity isn't just their name, its a business model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work properly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

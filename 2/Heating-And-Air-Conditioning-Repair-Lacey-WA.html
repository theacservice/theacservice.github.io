<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

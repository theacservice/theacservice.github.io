<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature level all year round.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air).

Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not accomplish a low humidity.

A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

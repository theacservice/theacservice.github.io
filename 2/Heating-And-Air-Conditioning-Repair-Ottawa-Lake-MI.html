<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Ottawa Lake MI</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My wife stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have actually fulfilled in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us.

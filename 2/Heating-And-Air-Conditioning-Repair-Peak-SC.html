<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>

<p>Normally the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

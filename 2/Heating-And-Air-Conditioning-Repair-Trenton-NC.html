<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

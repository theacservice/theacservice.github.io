<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

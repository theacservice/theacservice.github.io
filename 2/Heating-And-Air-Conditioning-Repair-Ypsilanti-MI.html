<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

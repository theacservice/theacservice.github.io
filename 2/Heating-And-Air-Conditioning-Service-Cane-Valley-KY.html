<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically only available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>

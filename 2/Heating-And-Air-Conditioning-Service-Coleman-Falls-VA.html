An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but significant modifications in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summers and for environmental reasons.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

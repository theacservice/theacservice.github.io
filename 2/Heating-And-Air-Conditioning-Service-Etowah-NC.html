<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and really educated. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was clearly sensible.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

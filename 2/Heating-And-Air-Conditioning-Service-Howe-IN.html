<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Howe IN</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

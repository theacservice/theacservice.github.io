<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot builds up inside the ducts, decreasing their effectiveness with time.

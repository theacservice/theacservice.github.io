<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation.

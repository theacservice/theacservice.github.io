Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>

Sending heat through strong items will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a radiant system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the many advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>

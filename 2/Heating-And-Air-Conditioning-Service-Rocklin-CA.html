<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>

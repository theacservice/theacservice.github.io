<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other benefits. Some companies offer top priority appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>

<p>Because these activities produce large quantities of lead dust, people have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or housing department for ideas on which public firms or private labs may have the ability to help test your house for lead in paint. Home test kits can not identify percentages of lead under some conditions. Employ a person with unique training for fixing lead paint problems to eliminate lead-based paint. Residents, particularly kids and pregnant ladies, must leave the structure up until all work is completed and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>We have been extremely delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked effectively and is so efficient that it significantly minimized our utility expenses - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergency situations they responded quickly and fixed the issue.<p>

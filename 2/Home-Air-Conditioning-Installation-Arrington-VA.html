<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>

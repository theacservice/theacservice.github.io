Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%.

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trusted than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>

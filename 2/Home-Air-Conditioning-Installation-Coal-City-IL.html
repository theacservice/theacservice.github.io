<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Toxins could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

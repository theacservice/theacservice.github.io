<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

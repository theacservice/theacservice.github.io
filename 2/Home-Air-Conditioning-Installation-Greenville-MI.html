<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be?

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.

Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to provide adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air).

<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

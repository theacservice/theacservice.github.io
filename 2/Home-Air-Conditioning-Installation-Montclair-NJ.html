Improper change, typically shown by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you acquire a new gas range or range. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>

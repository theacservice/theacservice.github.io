Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>

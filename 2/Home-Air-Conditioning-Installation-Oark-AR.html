<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the two types.

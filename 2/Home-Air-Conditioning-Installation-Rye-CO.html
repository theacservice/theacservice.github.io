<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

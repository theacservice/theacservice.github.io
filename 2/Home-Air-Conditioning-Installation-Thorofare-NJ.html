<p>Remember that the SEER rating is computed using the same set of temperatures throughout the board. The average summer temperature to get to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to get to the proper SEER ranking for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>

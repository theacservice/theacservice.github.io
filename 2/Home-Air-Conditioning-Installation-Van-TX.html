<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

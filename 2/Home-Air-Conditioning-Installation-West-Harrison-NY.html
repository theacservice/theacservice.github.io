<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

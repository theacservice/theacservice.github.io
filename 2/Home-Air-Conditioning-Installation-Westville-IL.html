<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

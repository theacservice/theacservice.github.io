<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

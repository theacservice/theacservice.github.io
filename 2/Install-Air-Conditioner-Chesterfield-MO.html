<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Installation in Indio CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

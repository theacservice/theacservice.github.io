Luckily, there are actions that many people can take both to lower the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new issues from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental expenses. Since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground, it secures the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical energy, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating unit that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we provide guidance to change rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>

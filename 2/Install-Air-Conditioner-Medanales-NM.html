<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

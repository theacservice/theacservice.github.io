<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The ability of natural chemicals to trigger health impacts differs considerably, from those that are highly poisonous, to those without any recognized health impact.

Eye and breathing system irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, visual disorders, and memory problems are amongst the instant symptoms that some individuals have experienced not long after exposure to some organics.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>

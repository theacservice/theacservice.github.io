<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.

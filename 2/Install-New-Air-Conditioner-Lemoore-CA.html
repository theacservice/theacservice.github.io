<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

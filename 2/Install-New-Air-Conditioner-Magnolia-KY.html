<h3>Picking the Right HVAC System For The Job in Magnolia KY</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

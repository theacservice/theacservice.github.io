<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are many other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>

<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be efficiently identified or treated without a detailed building investigation. These examinations may start with written surveys and telephone assessments in which structure detectives evaluate the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. In many cases, these questions may quickly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might pick to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be better to replace the whole system.<p>

<p>We take a look at clues before we provide recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Yearly furnace maintenance is the best method to keep your heating system working safely and efficiently. That's why we provide our distinct Convenience First Membership that makes preventive care easy and inexpensive. Ask us about our maintenance program that can conserve you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Because when you look after your furnace, it will look after you with lower energy bills, fewer repairs, and more years of comfort.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>

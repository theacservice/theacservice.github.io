<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is associated with a greater prevalence of resident respiratory problems.<p>

Each choice can and will considerably affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>

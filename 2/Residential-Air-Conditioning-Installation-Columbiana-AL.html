<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

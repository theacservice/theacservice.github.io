<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be smarter to change the whole system.<p>

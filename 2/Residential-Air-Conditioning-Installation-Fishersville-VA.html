<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.

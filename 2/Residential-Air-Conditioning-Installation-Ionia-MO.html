<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room.

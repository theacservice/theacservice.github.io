<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>To establish a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your location in an online search.

Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

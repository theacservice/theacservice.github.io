<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and cooling system. There are several design techniques in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

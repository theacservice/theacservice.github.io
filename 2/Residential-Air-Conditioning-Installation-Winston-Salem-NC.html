<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Winston Salem NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

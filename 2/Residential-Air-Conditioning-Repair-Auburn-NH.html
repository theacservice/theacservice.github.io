<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

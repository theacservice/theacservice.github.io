<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>

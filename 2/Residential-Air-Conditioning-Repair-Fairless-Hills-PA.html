<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

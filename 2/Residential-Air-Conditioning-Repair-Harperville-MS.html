<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear higher than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to point out the money you'll save on repair expenses.

<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the same duration. Generally, SEER provides more data based on how the EER carries out in different temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>

In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities.

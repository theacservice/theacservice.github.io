<h3>Heating Company in Jupiter FL</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

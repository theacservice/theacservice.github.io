<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our choices did an exceptional job in making sure we comprehended the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The professionals who installed the brand-new system were fast and professional, while requiring time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>

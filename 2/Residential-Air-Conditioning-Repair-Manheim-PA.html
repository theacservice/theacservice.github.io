<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

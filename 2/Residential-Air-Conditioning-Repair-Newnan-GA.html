My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system.

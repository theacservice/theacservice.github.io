<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Oaklyn NJ</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

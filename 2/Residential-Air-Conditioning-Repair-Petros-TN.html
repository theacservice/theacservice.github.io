<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>

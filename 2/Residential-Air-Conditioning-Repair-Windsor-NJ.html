<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Windsor NJ</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>

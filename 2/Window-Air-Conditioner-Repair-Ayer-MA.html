<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

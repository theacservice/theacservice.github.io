<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Fayette Mississippi</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>As with many home enhancement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary extensively based upon the size of the house. A lot of heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years.

A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Fontana CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>

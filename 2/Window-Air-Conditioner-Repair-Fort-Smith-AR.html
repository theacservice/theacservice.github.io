<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Fort Smith AR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.

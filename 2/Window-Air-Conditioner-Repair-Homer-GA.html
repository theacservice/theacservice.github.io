<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Prior to it was understood how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>

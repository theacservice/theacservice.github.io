<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>

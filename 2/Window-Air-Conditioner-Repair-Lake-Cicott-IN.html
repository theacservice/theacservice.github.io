A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers impact your convenience, they can also result in duct leakages due to extreme air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a great idea. You will not save any additional money and will wind up triggering more issues for your heating unit.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in large commercial structures can not be effectively identified or fixed without a comprehensive structure examination.

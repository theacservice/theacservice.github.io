<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>

<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Mound Minnesota</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>

<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

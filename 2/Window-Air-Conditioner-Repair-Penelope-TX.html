<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. In some cases it's not a major issue, and your system might just require some maintenance work. It is surprising how many of us practice preventive maintenance on our vehicles, for example, but don't do the same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter.

By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Penelope TX</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

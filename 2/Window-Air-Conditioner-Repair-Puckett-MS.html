<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>

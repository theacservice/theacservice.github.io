<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

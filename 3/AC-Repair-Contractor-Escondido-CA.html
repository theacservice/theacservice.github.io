The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

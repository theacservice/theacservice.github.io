<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on price. It's hard to discover a truthful AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as healthcare facilities and skyscrapers, cars such as cars and trucks, trains, submarines, ships and airplanes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>

<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Business in Los Angeles.

<p>UW students, visitors and staff members ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform various activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact an individual's performance, health, and comfort.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and keep healthy and comfortable environments without impurities. A crucial part of the program is reacting to and solving issues of building residents about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

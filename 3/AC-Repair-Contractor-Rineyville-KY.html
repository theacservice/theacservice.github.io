<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

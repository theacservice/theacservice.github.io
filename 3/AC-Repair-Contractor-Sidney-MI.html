What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working.

Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same).

Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>

To ensure the unit you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation price quote to identify the exact type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we do not simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have.

This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heating system) with the same quantity of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

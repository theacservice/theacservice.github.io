During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to assist us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings.

Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.

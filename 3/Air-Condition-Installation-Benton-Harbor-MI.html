<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very humid environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

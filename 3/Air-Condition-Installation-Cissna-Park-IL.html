<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transfer the heat to the spaces.

The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>

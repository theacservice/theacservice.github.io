<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>

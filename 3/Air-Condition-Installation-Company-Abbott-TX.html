<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing clients during the sluggish season can help reduce the peak season strain on your tech crew, as noted in A/c, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Professionals can mostly concentrate on responding to calls from new consumers, while your established clients remain pleased as their HVAC systems hum along well thanks to proactive checkups.

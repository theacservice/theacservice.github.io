<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage. Because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

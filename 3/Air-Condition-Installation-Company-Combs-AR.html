At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>I have actually utilized all the time for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has been fantastic through all these years.

<p>The company's head office is based in Cosmo City, Gauteng, and where they disperse their item in all areas in South Africa and nearby nations, such as Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. There are Jet-Air branches in the Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Free State and North West, to offer better customer experiences and ease of access of the products in every area.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

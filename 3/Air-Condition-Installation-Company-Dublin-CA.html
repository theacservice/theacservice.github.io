For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

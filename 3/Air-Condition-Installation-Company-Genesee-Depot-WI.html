<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

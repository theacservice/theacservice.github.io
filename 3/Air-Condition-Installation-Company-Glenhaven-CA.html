<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.

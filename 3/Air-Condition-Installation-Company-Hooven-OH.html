<h3>Truth About Hooven OH Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

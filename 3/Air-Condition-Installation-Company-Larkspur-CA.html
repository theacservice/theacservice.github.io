<h3>AC Replacement in Larkspur CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

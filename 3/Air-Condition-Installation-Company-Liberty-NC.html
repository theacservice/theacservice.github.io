<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Liberty NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Local HVAC Companies in Liberty NC</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.

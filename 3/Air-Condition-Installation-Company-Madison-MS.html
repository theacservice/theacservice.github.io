<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>

<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

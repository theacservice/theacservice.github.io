<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until many years after exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task sites.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in New Milford NJ</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the house from household pipes that is made with lead products.

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust exterior.

<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Brinson GA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

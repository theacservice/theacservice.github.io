<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals.

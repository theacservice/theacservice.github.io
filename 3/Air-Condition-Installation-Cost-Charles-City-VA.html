<h3>AC Compressor in Charles City VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

It was an enjoyment dealing with such a professional company and would highly suggest them to anyone looking for HVAC.<p>

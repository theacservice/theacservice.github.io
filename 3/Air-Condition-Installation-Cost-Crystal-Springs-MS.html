An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

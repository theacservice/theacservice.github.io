In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed.

Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up indoors.<p>

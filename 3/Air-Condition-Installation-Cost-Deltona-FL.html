<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Deltona FL</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are typically set up in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

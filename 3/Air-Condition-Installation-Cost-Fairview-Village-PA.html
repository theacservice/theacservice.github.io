<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Role in Fremont MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

No extra charge.<p>

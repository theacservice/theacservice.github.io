My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

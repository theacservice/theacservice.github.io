<h3>Ventilation Systems in New Blaine AR</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>

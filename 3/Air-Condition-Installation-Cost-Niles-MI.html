<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is normally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

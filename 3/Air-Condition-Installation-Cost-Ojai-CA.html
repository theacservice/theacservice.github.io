<p>There are two main kinds of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>

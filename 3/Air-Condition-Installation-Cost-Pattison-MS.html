<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime.

This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>It is particularly crucial to take as a number of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating systems, cooking, or engaging in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You may also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather permits.<p>

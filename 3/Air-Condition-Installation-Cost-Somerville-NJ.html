<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

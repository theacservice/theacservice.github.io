<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

However, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners.

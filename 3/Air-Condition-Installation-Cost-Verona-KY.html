<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Verona KY?</h3>
<p>A split a/c system might cost near that of a standard HVAC system however has shown to be an alternative cost reliable option to homes that do not have ductwork. Used together with other types of heating or cooling, such as portable or window a/c, space heating units, or oil heating units, it can enhance the comfort of your house while keeping your month-to-month utility expense affordable.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

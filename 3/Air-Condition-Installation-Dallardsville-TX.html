<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Bioaerosols launched into the air can be distributed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause transmittable diseases such as Legionnaires' illness. They also can trigger allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Symptoms triggered by biological toxins include sneezing, eye inflammation, coughing, lightheadedness, and respiratory infections.<p>

The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>

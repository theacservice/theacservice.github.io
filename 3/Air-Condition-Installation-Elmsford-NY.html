<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain toxic substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The main hazard of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than many allergenic properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes personallies that already have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>

<p>You could upgrade to the highest performance gear readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air prior to it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized inadequate ventilation as the main issue in over half the workplace indoor air investigations it has actually conducted. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>

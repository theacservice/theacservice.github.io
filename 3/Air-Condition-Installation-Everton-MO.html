<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

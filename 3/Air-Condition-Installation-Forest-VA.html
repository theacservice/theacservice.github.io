<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>

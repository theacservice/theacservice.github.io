<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

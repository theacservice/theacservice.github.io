<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow limitation will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at greater temperatures.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant floor heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or modified.

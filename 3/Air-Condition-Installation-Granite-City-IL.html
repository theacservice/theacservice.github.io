<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your cars and truck.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>

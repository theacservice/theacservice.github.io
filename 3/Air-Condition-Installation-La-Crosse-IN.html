<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in La Crosse IN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

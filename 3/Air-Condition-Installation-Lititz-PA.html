<p>Consider potential results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system appropriately changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>

<h3>Furnace Repair Cost in Midwest WY</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

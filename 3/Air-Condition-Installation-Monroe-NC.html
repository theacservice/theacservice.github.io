All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

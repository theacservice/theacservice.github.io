<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, a lot of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>

<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher salaries for air conditioning tradesmen.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest typical incomes for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

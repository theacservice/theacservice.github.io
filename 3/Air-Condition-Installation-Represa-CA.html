<h3>Designing Tips for Central Heating Systems at Represa CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source units. The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>

<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level.

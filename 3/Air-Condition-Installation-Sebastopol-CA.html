<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>

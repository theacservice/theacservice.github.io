<h3>Locating Best HVAC Contractors in Teachey NC</h3>
<p>When constructing your brand-new home a well-functioning Cooling and heating system is important, in addition to the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources necessary to help from the preparation phases through to the last installation. We utilize the most recent software to help develop your ductwork system and use the greatest quality materials in the construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

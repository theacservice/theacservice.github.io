<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Titusville NJ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

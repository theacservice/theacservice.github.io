<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters.

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a much better deal, for exceptional service.

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Bloomingdale NJ</h3>

A foundation like that and an enthusiasm to do the right thing is what makes our company what it is today. A Leading Technological HVAC thought leader and the only place to get a 5 year part service warranty with repairs.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

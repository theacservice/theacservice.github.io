Reputable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. However then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

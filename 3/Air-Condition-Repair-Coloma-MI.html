<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>For instance, problems emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outside air.

<p>Keep in mind that the SEER rating is calculated using the very same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The average summer season temperature level to get to the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the correct SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new air conditioning systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the outcome of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Office temperatures ought to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air circulation should be avoided.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

If left overlooked, a furnace is susceptible to breakdowns, performance problems, and catastrophic failures, which might cause severe emergency situations. Our local furnace maintenance specialists are prepared to provide your furnace with the attention it requires to last for several years to come. We provide a range of maintenance plans to fit all needs and budgets.<p>

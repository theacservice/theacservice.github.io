<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air contaminant could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>

<h3>HVAC repair services in Encino CA</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to examine scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were really professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at maximum performance and could overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy expenses to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your house. It will have to work harder and might get too hot if the system is too little. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>

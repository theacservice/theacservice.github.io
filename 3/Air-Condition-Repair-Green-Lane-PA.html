Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are typically mistaken for the flu. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, nausea, disorientation and tiredness. The effects of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from person to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>

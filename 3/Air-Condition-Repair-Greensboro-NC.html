<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Greensboro North Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heat pumps work best in a moderate climate, where the temperature does not get too low or too high. Simply put, they are perfect for our Seattle environment! They are extremely efficient, beating out most other kinds of heater in efficiency. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation typically costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally means it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>

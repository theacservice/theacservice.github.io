<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature. Heaters that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

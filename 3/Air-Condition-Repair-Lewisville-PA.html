<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

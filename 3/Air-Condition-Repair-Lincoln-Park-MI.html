<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it via software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>

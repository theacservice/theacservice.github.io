What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

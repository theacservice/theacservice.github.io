<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.

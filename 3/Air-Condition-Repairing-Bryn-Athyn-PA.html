<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Bryn Athyn PA</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system also requires to be in leading condition for the ac system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the home. The technician can analyze the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or excessive dirt if the individual parts are in proper order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

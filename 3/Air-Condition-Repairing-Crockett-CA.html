<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

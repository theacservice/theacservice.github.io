Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven.

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

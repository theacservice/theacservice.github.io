<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long method towards reducing many of the issues triggered by build-up of dirt and debris, and the evaluations allow your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term problems and take proactive actions to help prevent early failure or bothersome breakdowns throughout the heating season.

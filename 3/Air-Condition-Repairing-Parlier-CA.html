<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

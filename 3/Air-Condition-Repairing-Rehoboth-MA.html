I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

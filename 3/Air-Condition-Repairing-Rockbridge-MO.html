<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>

Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

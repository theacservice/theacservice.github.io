Numerous typical building materials used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air during the removal procedure, removal of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly optimal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is often advised instead.<p>

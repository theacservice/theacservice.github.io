<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

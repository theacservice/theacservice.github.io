<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Sullivans Island SC</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and very well-informed. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. Due to the fact that the cost was undoubtedly affordable, I did not bother to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

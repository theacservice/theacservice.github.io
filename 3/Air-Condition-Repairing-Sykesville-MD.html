<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

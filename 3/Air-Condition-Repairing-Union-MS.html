<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

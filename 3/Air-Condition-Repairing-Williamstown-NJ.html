<p>For example, contaminants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outside air intake lies near a source of wetness or other outside contaminant, it might function as a pathway to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it needs to-- if particles is blocking the outdoor air intake, for example, or the filters are infected or poorly kept.<p>

<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit.

<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully.

The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>

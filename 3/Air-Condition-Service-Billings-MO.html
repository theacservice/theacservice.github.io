<p>Usually the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

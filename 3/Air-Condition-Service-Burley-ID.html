<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a variety of sources; the United States Epa (EPA) has actually recognized building materials, home furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the danger likewise originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating system remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>

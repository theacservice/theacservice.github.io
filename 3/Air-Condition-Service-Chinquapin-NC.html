<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

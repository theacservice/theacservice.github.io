Permeable materials, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>

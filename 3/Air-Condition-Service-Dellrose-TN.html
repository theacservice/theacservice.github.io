<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>You could upgrade to the highest efficiency gear readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Seattle heating systems can run nine months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to an automobile it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected lifespan of 15 years.

<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older houses might contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>

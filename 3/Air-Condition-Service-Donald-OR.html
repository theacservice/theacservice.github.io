<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>

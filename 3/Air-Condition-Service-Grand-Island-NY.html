<p>New a/c generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score means higher energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER score for you depends on your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally allowed SEER rating is going to be far more energy effective than your existing, old air conditioning system.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Grand Island NY</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I proceeded and purchased this Provider and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool off your home which is among the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

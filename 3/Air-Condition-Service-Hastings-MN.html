<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

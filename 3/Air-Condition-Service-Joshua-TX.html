<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, nowadays. While lots of people assume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your house (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not think adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are breathed in, they can build up and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up till several years after direct exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task websites.<p>

The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that immunity varies considerably from specific to specific, it is not useful to design a universal standard fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health.

The building type consisted of both residential and commercial. Most of samples evaluated were tested favorable for fungi and bacteria.<p>

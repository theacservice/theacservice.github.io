<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Kansas City KS</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the concern and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products provide a danger only when they are dealt with in a way that develops dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being air-borne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for significant health problems.<p>

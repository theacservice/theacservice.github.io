Underground temperature stays constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems offer consistent and reputable cooling and heating.<p>
<p>Numerous detach blocks include 2 cartridge fuses. Inspect them before you proceed with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse signifies a failing part inside the condensing unit.

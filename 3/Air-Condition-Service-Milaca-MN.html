<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

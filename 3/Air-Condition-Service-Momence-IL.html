All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it.

However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold.

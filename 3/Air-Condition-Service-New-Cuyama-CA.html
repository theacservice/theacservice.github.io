<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.

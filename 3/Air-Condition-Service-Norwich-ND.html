<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under numerous owners. Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your house still warms to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel really hot. If your home is not heating up, just be worried. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should hire a specialist to inspect and repair the system.<p>

<p>You could upgrade to the highest performance gear readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system.

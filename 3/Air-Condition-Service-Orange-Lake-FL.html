All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

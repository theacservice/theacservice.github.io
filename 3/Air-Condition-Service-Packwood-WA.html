<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Packwood WA</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing clever technology. Martin stated the company can develop a dashboard within the building's controls that will offer information on its systems to permit real time visibility, supplying the capability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial client, not simply throughout new building and construction.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

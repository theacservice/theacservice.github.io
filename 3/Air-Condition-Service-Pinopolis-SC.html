<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our options did an outstanding task in making certain we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The technicians who set up the new system were quick and professional, while requiring time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>

Buildings constantly develop as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly interacting, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing a little with time as it ends up being dirty, then is cleaned, collects dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.

<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

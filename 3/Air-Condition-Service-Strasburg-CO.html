<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material in time.

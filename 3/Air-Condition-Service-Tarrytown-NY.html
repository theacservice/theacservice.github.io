<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of illness caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

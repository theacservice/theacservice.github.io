I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event.

Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these devices).

<p>No matter the kind of electric glowing floor heating unit, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any disturbance or interruption in the flow of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is among the downsides to installing an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, assuming they are set up properly and correctly taken care of, the possibility of them having problems is small.<p>

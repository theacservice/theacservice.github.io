Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

Before we design and set up any systems, we schedule a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental enhancements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise numerous competent house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>

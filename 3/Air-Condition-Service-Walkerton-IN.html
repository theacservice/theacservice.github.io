<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

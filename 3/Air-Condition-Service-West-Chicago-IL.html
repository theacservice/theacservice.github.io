<p>We look at ideas before we provide advice to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

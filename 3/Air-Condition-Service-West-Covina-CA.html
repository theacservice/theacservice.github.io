<p>Filters can get filthy easily, specifically if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>

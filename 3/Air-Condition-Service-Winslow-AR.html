<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

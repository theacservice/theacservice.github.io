The quality of air in residential structures has actually become an essential issue to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination research studies have actually determined several pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these pollutants are necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

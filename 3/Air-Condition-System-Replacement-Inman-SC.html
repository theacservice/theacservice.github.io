(Be sure that products you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated area however are also securely out of reach of children.) Do not simply toss these unwanted items in the trash bin.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

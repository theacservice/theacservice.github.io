<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

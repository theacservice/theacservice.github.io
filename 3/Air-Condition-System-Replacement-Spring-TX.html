<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>

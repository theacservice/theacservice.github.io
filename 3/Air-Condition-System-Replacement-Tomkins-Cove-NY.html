All the wet hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the area that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining effectively. A restriction in your drainage pipelines causes a water leakage. There are various places a clog can occur. Among the main locations where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

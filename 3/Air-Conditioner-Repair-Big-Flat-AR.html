<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Big Flat AR</h3>
<p>There are lots of reasons why this can take place. The bright side is that you can deal with a lot of these aspects by yourself without the need to call for professional aid. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that carry on to checking the thermostat settings. Next, examine the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can also inspect the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot burner to make certain it is lit.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

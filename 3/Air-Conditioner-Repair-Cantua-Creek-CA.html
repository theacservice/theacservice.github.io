<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (houses normally utilize between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

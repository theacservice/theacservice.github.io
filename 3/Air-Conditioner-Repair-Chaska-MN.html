<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might become clogged, decreasing air flow distribution, quality, and volume. They also may end up being places for molds and bacteria to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be effectively maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>

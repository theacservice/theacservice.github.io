We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>Furnace Installation in Mc Adams MS</h3>

They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

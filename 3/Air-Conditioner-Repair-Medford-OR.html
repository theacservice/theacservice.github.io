<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter once every three months. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

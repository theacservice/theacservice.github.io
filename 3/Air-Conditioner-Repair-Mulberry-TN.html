<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally require excavation to install, which includes numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

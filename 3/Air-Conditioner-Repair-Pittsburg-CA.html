<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day.

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in Pittsburg CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After contacting Integrity we were provided a fantastic quote on a radiant flooring system. We remained in a time crunch for upcoming event, and Tyler came right out and had us attached in a number of days. The systems works wonderful and the brand-new workplace feels extremely comfortable. It was a satisfaction working with such a professional company and would highly advise them to anyone searching for HVAC.<p>
<p>Many people are becoming more mindful and worried about their health and the impact of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including toxins and irritants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it should be eliminated to revitalize the quality and improve of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Pipes, Seattle, WA cleans up the duct physically by removing the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>

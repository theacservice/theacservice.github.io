The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems should be inspected a minimum of two times per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Once every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you must get your HVAC system visually inspected at least. This assessment is an essential aspect of HVAC maintenance.

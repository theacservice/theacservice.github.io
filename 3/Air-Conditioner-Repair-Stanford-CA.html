<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>

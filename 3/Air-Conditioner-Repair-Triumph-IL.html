Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

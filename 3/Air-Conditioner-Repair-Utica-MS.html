<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Utica MS Home</h3>

As premiere heating and AC contractors, we can assess if your current air conditioning system or heater fits your requirements or if a much better option exists.

Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

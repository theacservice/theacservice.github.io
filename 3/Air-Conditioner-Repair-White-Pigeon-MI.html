<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

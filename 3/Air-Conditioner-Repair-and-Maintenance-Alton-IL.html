<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Alton IL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

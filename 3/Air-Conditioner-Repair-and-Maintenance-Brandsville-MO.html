<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

<p>If your single stage air conditioning system isn't old enough to justify replacement, consider an entire house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices.

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>

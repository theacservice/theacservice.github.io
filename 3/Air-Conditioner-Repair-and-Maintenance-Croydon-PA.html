<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Also Camryn supplied excellent client service at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Damp and wet conditions breed mold and mildew that can activate breathing issues like allergies and asthma. Depending on your place, the hot summer months can cause particularly humid conditions.

There are a range of humidifier options that will help preserve consistent humidity levels and create comfy living conditions in your home.<p>

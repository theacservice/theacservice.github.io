<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The heatpump acquired popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air within. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate environments, but with improvements in low temperature operation and minimized loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of thirty days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Simply a couple of years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have actually been lots of long, dry, hot streaks since then. A central air conditioning system in your house means you have the power to adjust the temperature level to a constant temperature level when the heat gets intolerable.<p>

<p>Many well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great idea to think about energy performance. By selecting a central AC system that has as high of an efficiency rating as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Efficiency rankings must be labeled with all systems. While effective systems may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated appliance is a great method to enjoy additional comfort.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your home is located, the local area's climate can alter significantly. A house located in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would need a much bigger heating capability also which will affect costs. See the chart listed below for the average central air conditioner replacement expenses by HEAPS.<p>

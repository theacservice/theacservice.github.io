<h3>Heating And Cooling Repair in Newport Beach CA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

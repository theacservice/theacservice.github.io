<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<h3>Commercial HVAC Contractors in Shepherdsville KY</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and insufficient or excessive air circulation. Work environment temperature levels need to be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air flow need to be prevented.<p>

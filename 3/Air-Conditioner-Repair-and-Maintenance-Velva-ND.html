The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>

A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.

In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>You need to always employ a professional to carry out AC repair, for the same factor that you rely on an expert plumber or electrician.

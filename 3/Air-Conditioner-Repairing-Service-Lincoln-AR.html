<p>Oil furnaces are generally not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been finished, the last task is to check the system to make certain it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check may mention faults in the thermostat, which may be as easy as a need to replace batteries. A failure to switch on might simply include a tripped breaker.

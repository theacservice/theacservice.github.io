<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>

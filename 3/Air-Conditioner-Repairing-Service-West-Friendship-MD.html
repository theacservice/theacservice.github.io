<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin resulting from gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

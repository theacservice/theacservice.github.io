<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

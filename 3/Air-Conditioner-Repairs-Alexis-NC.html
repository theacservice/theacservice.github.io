<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Germs and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

Symptoms of health problems brought on by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive problems.<p>

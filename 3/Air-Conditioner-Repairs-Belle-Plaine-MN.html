<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>Particular kinds of HVAC systems are a little more costly than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are nicely concealed inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and visually pleasing to look at. They provide effective air flow and are substantially more effective than basic wall systems and can, therefore, lower the variety of units required and this can decrease installation and or replacement costs where multiple HVAC units are required. Ducted commercial-grade a/c systems are BETTER for the academic environment. They are typically the most expensive option; however, they are also the most visually pleasing as the duct-work and internal units hidden with minimal presence.<p>

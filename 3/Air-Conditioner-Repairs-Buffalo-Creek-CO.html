<h3>Home Furnace in Buffalo Creek Colorado</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>This is my third time utilizing Around the Clock.

<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd problem that periodically comes up. When you do discover your furnace acting strangely, it is very important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you respond to concerns with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the problem worse, and typically more expensive.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less common now than natural gas, however they can be helpful in more remote regions where utilities are harder to access, and in cooler climates since it supplies more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be higher, as much as 3 times greater than gas or electric heating systems. They need a storage tank on the immediate property and more maintenance. In general, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. In general, they offer an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

<p>New a/c generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score means higher energy effectiveness and possibly lower energy bills. A good SEER score for you depends on your house size, where you live and other factors.

It's not always about choosing the model with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealership can assist.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas furnaces While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the two types. Gas heaters cost about the very same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>

<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel.

<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning at Cologne NJ</h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

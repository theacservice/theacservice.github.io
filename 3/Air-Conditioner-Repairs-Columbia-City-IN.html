<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Columbia City IN</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>

<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

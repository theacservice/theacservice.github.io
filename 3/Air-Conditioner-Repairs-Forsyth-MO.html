<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. 5 Star Mechanical Heating and Air Conditioning are totally accredited, licensed, and guaranteed to service commercial services throughout Seattle.

<p>More common in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual spaces.

Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, typically described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

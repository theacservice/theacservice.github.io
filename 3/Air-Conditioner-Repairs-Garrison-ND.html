<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits use dose-response information which reveal the health effects of repetitive exposure to one specific chemical.

(He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

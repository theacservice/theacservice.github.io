<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in over half the office indoor air examinations it has actually performed. Examinations carried out in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the very same to be real. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is very important in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.

<p>Specialist heating system setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>

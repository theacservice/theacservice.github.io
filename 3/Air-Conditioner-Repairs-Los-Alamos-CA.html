The probability of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends upon private sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Expect the average mobile home oil furnace to have starting costs of around $1,500. Keep in mind that not as numerous brand names produce oil furnaces for this usage, and you might discover more options with gas, lp, or electric heaters.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>

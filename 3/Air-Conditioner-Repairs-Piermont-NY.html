Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>

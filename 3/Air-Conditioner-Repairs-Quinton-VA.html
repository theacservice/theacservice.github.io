<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Quinton VA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution. If the present system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>

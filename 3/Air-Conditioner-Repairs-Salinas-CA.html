<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space cooling offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>

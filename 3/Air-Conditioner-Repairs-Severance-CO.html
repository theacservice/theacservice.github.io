<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

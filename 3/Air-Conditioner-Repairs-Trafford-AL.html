An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture.

<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher wages for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for knowledgeable trades.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

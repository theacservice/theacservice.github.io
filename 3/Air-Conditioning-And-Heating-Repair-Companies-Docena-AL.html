They both did a fantastic job. Sabre's workplace personnel is really useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and providing the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly recommend.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>

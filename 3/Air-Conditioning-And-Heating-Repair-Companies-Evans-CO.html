<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, condenser, and evaporator are all situated in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roof or on a concrete slab beside your house's foundation. This kind of air conditioning system also is used in small commercial structures.

<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace devices, cleaning items, construction carpets, furnishings and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor toxins. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

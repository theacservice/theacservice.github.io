<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.

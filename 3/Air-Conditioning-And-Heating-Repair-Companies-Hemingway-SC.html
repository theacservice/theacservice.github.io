<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality.

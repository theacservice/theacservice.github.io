<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where moisture levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>

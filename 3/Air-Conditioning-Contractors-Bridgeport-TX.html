Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic.

Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the type of heat.<p>

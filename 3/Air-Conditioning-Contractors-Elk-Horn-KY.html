<h3>AC Service in Elk Horn KY</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces.

Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

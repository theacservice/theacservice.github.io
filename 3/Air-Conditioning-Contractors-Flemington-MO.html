<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Flemington MO HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. If the individual parts remain in proper order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or extreme dirt. Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler home in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

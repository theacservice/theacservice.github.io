<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists suggest following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

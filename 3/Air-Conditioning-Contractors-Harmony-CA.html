<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>These men have been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these men twice.

The Residential HVAC Service Technician certificate opens many doors of opportunity for HGTC graduates.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>

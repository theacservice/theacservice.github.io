<p>If your air conditioner is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's a basic problem like particles clogging the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your house.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

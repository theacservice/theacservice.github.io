<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.

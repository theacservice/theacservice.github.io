<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

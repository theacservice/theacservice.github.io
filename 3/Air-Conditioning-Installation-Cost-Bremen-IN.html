No additional charge.<p>

Also they identified the issue and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>

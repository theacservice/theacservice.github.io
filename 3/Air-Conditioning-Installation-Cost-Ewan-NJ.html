<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the exact same indoor air problems as single-family houses due to the fact that much of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, furnishings, and home products, are similar. Indoor air problems comparable to those in workplaces are triggered by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, poorly put outside air consumptions, or maintenance activities.<p>

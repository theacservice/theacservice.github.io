This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, an expert service person need to be called for almost any maintenance besides routine cleaning.

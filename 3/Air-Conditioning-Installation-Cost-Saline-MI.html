Termite damage can be minimized or prevented by making certain that wooden building products do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood away from the home. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be significantly reduced.<p>

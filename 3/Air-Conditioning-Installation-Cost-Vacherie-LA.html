<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution.

Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

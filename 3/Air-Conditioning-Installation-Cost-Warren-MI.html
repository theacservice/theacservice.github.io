<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure.

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

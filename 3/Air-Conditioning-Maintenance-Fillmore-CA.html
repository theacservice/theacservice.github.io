<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified.

<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.

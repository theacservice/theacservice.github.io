<p>Though it might be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are many other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, however result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be perpetrators, too.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>

Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>

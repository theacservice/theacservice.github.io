<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved issues. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

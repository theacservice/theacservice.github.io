<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system.

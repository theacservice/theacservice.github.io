<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Bedford NY?</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is normally utilized in a third-floor or 2nd location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

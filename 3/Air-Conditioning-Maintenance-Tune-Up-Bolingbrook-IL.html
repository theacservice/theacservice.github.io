<p>The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>The most typical type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive option, but newer systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective natural gas heaters can attain AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>

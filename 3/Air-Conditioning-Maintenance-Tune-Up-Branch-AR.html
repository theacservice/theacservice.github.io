<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>

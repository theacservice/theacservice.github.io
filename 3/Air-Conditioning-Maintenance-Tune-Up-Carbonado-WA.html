<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.)

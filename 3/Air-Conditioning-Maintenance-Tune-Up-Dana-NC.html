<p>A customized ac system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

We will conduct a complete examination of your house or company and offer ideas on how you can effectively maintain the level of convenience.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>There's no getting away that all equipment ages with time. But that does not imply that older chillers can not take advantage of mechanical upgrades. We provide a wide range of modernization, retrofit and update options for numerous devices types.

Cooling tower retrofits and other ancillary devices in your HVAC portfolio can be improved with instant impact on your bottom line.

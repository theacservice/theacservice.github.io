<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that best temperature throughout the year.

Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

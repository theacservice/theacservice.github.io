<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season.

They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

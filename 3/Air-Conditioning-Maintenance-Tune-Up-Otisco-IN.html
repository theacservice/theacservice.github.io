<p>These people have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases need contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house might cost.

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

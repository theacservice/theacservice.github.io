Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems.

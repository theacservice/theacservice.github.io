<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfortable climate in every space.

While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the devices and approaches utilized by duct-cleaning companies have altered since these studies were conducted, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>

<p>Today's home convected heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass.

Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are generally utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>

<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

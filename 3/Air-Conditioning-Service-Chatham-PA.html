<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>

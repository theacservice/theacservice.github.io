<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost.

Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen.

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department suggestions.<p>

<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house.

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, unpredictable organic compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause negative health conditions. Source control, filtration and the use of ventilation to water down contaminants are the main techniques for enhancing indoor air quality in the majority of structures. Residential systems can even more improve indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Air flow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure differences created by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>

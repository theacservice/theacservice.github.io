<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building materials utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is typically recommended instead.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day.

<h3>Air Condition Service in Manchester NH</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

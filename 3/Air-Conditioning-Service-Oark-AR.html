<p>There are lots of actions a property owner can require to select items that will prevent indoor air problems from occurring - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using strong wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet.

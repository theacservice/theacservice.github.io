<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, especially in an older home. Depending upon the kind of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>

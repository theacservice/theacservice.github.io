<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Sophia NC</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to examine situation & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going however also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were really professional, polite and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>

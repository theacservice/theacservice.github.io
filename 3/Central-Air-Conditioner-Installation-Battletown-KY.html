Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

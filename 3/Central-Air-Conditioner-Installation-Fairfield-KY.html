<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not just will blocked vents and signs up affect your comfort, they can also lead to duct leaks due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

Practically all hydronic glowing flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly flexible, won't rust and comes in long lengths, which permit PEX pipe to be woven with very little or no joints.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He had to go get the proper replacement.

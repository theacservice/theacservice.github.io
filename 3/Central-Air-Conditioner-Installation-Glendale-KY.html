<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>

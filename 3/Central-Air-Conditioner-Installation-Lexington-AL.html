The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

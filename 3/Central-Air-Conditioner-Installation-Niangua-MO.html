<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Heaters that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

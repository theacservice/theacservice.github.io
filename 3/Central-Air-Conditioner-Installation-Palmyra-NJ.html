<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>

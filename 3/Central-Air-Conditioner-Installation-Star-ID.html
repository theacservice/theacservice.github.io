<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can exacerbate issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it's important to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>

They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My partner stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have satisfied in a long time.

<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently higher salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competitors for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical incomes for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 annually.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>

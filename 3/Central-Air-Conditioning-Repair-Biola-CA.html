<p>They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my needs completely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and changed two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the new heaters can heat the house. Honestly, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>

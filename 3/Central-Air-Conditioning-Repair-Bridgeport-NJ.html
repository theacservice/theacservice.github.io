<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summertimes. The best thing to do is making certain that the heater burners are examined and cleaned thoroughly before cooler seasons start. Constantly make sure that the furnace is cleaned up annually to prevent soot and condensation which causes burners to stop working effectively. If your furnace remains in a very bad condition, maybe it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

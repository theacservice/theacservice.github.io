Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

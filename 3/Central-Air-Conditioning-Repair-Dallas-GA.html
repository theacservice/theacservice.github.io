<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Dallas GA</h3>
<p>Often, heating repairs are merely not possible. Maybe your furnace is too old, your heat pump is too damaged, or your boiler simply can't be repaired. Whatever the case, certain circumstances require major heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have been assisting property owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland replace their houses' heating systems when their old ones are no longer functional.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

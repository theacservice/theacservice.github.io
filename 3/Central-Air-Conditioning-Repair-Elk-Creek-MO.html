Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

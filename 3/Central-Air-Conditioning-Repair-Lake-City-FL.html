Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, typically with no tools required.

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>

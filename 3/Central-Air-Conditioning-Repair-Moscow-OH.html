"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

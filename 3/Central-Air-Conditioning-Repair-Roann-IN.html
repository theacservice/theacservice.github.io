<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Roann IN Home</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

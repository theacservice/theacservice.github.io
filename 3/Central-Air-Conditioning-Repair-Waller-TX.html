<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>

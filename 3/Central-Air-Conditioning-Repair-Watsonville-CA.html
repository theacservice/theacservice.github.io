<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>

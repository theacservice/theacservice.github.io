<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

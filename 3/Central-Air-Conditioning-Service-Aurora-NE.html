<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Aurora NE</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems should be checked at least two times annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

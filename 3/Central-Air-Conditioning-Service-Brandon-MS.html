(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

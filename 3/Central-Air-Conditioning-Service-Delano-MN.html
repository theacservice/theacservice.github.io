<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>

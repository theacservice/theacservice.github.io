<p>Houses can have the very same indoor air issues as single-family homes because a lot of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and household products, are comparable. Indoor air issues similar to those in offices are caused by such sources as contaminated ventilation systems, incorrectly positioned outside air intakes, or maintenance activities.<p>
<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Desert Hot Springs California</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of workers in the location, stale air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of infected soil tracked within, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>

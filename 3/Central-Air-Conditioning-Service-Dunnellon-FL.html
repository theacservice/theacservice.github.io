<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

<p>Using air filters can trap some of the air toxins.

Dust can act as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can lower the efficiency of the coils.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings typically feature greater cost. So, make certain to choose based upon how frequently you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For the majority of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an extremely high ranked heating unit is not always needed.<p>

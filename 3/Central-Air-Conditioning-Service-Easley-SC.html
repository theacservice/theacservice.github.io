<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Forney TX</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used various methodologies. The CMHC research study gotten in touch with several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or techniques utilized.

While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed since these studies were performed, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

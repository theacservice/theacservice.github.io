<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Mansfield TX Home Owners</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using clever technology.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

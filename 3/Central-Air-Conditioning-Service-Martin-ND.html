<p>As an IMPORTANT SERVICES BUSINESS, we remain Available and open to aid with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical requirements. However, in the United States, as in other nations, regulative development largely stops at the doorway. This is not to say that there aren't requirements for levels of CO and NO2; many bodies have actually set standards and standards for both In the United States, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Security and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA) have actually set CO guidelines, however the EPA's standards only use to outside air. OSHA, NIOSH and others have set NO2 requirements, and the World Health Company (WHO) has set standards for both-- consisting of for indoor air.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.

<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions.

Stale air may likewise be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the variety of employees in the area.<p>
<p>The answer to the concern, What does an HVAC technician do?, will vary somewhat depending upon market of specialty, position, and work. What does not differ is the significance of the work that these technicians do.

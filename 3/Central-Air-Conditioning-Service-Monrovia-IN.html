<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..

<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty.

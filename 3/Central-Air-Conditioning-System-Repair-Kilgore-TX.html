<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Kilgore TX</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

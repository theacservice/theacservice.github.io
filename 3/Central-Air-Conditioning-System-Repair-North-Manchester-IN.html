<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many individuals presume contamination is just an outside problem, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we don't think adequate about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right away, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The few times we require them for emergency situations they reacted rapidly and solved the issue.<p>

Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling.

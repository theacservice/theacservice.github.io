<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide gas, radon, volatile natural compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce adverse health conditions.

<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth.

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales man concerns your home he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness.

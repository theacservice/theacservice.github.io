<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Radiant VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Since it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>

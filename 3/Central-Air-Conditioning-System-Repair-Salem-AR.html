<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

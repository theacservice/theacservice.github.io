<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Selecting the best size air conditioning unit is a crucial part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to help you with. Here's why buying the best size a/c unit matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll wind up squandering money and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>Given that heating and cooling work might likewise require installing or repairing pipes to supply oil or natural gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might also be required to hold a separate plumbing's license or have a licensed plumber on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this line of work. When getting a price quote, be sure to ask not only if a company is licensed, but likewise what type of license it holds.<p>

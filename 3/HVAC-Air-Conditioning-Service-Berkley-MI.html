<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

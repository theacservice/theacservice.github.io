<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

It is likewise their obligation to inform employees of the immediate dangers that are present.Specific state and local guidelines may apply.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

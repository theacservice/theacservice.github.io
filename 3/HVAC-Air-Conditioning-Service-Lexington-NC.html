<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>

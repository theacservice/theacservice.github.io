<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Maywood California</h3>
<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and respected my home by constantly using boot coverings when entering my home. He showed the points of evaluation and also recommended I have a UV light installed due to a little accumulation of mold collecting in the air handler, which he thoroughly examined and cleaned the outside compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor system and advised an option to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I got a detailed email report of the inspection laying out all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

This means that cost savings are still recognized during the cooler duration. In truth, a desuperheater lowers winter water heating costs by roughly half.<p>

<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in Maywood CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

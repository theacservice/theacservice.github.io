<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>

<p>Ac system can produce a lot of water since they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler.

Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

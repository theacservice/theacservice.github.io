Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.

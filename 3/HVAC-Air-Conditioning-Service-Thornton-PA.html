<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The primary reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services used. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a maker's guarantee. Any major repairs need to be covered under the maker's guarantee. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>

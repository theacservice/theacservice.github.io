<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or fixed without a comprehensive structure investigation.

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>

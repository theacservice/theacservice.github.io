<h3>Choosing the Proper Company For Heating and AC Systems at Ava MO</h3>

My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>

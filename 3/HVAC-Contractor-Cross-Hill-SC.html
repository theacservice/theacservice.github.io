<p>Many people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can likewise have considerable, harmful result. EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels.

<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

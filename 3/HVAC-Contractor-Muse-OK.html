<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if essential, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually identified the difficulty location in examining the expense. He solved the problem in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I considered fair prior to he recalled, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>

<p>Specific instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically challenging to figure out if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to focus on the time and place the signs take place. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the heating, humidity, or cooling conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home.

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and readily available source of energy.<p>

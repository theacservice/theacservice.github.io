<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not accomplish an efficiency greater than 90%.

Since a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>

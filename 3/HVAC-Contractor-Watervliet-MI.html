<p>We called Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to examine circumstance & chose to go with them for the work.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.

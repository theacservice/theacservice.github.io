<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are excellent that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>

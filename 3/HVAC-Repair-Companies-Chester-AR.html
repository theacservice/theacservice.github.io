<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

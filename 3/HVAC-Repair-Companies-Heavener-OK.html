If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>HVAC System in Heavener OK</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

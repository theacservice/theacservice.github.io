<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful.

<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the problem location in examining the bill. He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, understood what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not take place once again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>

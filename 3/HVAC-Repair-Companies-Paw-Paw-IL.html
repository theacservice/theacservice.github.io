<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

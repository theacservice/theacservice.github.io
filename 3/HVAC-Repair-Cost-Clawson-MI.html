<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air flow.

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

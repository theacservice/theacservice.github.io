<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

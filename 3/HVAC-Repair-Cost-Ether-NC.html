We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more efficient than room a/c. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and hassle-free to run. To save energy and money, you must shop an energy-efficient a/c and reduce your central air conditioning conditioner's energy use. In an average air-conditioned home, cooling takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy each year, causing power plants to produce about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Ether NC</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans should be set up in all kitchen areas and bathrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are peaceful and resilient. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for a sufficient period of time. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

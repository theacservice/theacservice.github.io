<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Often a temporary indoor air quality issue is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area.

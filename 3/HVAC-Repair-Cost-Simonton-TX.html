But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

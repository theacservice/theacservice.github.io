<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Stanfield NC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

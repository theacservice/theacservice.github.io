<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness.

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems.

If temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>

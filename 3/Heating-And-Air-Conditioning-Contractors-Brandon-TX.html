<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

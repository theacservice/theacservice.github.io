<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..

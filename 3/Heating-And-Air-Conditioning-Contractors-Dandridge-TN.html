<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Replacing your old furnace with a brand-new, more effective model can fight volatile energy prices, reducing your heating expenses by up to 45%. Improvements in heating innovation have led to systems that pollute less, improve comfort, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace typically has an AFUE of about 65%. The most affordable efficiency enabled by law for brand-new gas models is 78%, and there are various options that accomplish 98%, for near total performance.<p>

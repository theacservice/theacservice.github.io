<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

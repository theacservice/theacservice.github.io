<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Support! Environment Pro is reputable and truly appreciated us and our situation. We came home one evening to a cold house. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might search for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my friends.<p>

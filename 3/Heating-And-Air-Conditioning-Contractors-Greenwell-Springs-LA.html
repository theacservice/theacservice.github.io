<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

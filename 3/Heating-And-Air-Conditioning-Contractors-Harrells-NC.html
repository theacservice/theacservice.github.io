<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

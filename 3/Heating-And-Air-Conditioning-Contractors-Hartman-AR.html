<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, eye, and throat irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain.

<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure occupants might be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the kind of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning items, building home furnishings, carpets and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

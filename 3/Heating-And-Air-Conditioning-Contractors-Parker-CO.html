<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>

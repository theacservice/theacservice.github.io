<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material gradually.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

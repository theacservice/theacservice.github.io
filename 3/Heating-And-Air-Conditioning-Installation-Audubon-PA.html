Nevertheless, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>

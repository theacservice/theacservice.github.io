<p>Oil furnaces are usually not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not achieve an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>

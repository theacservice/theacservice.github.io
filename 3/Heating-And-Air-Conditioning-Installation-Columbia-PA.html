<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or COP. It's a clinical method of determining just how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are discovered. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions.

When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are related to direct exposure to toxins from microbes that can grow in big building ventilation systems. However, these diseases can likewise be traced to microorganisms that grow in home heating and cooling humidifiers and systems. Kids, senior people, and people with breathing problems, allergic reactions, and lung diseases are especially prone to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.<p>

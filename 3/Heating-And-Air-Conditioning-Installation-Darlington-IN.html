What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>

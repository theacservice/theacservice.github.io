<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can become clogged with debris that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

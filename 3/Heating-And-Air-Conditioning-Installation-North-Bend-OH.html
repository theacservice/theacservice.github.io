<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.

In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new building.

The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your home and is critical iin ensuring the efficiency and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in tons. Normally, a 3-ton setup should be adequate for the average house, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all aspects which will affect the appropriate size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>

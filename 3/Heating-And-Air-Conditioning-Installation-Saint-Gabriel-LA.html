"Humidifier fever" is a typical illness caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building residents.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

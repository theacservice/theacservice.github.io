That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>

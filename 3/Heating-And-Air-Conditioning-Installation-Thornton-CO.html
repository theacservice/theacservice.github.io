<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

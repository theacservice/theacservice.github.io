This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>

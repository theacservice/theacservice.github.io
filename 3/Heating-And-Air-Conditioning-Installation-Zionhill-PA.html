<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>

He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>

Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

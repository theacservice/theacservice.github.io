<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>

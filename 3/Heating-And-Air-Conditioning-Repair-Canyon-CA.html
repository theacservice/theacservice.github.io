<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>

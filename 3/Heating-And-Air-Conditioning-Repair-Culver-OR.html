<p>These people have actually been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these people two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heating systems can heat your house. Truthfully, our house heater is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>

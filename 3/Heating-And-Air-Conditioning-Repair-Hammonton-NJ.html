Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).

<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Hammonton NJ Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>You should get your HVAC system visually examined at least once every year to make certain all the systems are working well. This inspection is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. You will not notice a problem up until it stops working in the middle of winter season if you don't get your system inspected. That's the last thing you desire since you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is repaired. Routine examination and maintenance also helps keep it in great shape and extends its life.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.

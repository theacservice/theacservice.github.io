<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>To establish a safe assessment or visit with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your area in an online search. Message or call professionals to ask whether they can carry out an assessment over the phone or perhaps over a video call.

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.

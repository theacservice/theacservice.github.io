<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Installation in Alton AL</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess situation & decided to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked with from starting to end were really professional, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered fantastic customer service at the end of the visit by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance tasks we may want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the market.<p>

<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat.

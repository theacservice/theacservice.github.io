<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>

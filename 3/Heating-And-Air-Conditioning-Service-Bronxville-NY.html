<p>Iâ $ m actually choosy with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs.

Am grateful I got this however because it has restored my faith in good production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got because I purchased it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just best.<p>

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>

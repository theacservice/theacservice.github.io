<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

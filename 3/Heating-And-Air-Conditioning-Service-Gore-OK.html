<p>In homes, the most considerable sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is normally acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

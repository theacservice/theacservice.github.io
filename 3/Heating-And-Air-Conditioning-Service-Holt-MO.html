<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Holt MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

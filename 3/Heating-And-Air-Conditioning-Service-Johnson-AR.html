Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many people.<p>

If your system is near, or past, its expected life-span, replacement may be the most cost-effective solution.<p>

This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space cooling supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Mendocino CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>

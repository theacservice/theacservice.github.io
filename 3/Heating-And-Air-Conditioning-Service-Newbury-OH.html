<h3>Repair and Care for Newbury OH Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature. Furnaces that kick on often may be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

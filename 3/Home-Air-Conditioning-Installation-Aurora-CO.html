<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

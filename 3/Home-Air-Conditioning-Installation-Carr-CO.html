<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically brought on by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main problem in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has actually conducted.

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the house. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and germs, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years back and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

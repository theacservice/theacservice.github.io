<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The simplest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>

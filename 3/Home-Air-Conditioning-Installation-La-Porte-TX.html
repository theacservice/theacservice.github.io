<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at La Porte TX</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>

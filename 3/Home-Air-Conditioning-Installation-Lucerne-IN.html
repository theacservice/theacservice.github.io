<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Lucerne IN</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

Excess wetness can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, uneven temperature level guideline, germs, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean up the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess wetness flows away from the system.<p>

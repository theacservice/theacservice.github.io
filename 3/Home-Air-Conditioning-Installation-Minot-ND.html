<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped.

<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, considering that it considers not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

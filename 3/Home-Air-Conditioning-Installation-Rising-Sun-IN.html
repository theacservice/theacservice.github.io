<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

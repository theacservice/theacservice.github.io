<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>

On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>

<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Antioch CA?</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional kind of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Space air conditioning system feature a thermostat sensor, located behind the control panel, which measures the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the a/c unit could cycle continuously or behave unpredictably. The sensing unit ought to be near the coil but not touching it; change its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>

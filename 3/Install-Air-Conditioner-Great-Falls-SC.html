<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Great Falls SC</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "general duty provision" applies. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that an employer needs to provide a safe and healthy  workplace. Hence, making certain the air is of good quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Many factors impact IAQ. These aspects consist of bad ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the building. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas in time) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>

<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Hazel Green Alabama</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company should inspect measurements of temperature level, air and humidity circulation.

<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home.

The average daytime temperature level highs throughout December, January, and February variety from the mid-40s to low-50s.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>

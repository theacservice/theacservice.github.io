Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve).

If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

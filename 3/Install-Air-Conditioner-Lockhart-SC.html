<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

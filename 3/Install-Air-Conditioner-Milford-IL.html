<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>For instance, impurities might collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor contaminant, it might act as a path to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it needs to-- if particles is obstructing the outdoor air consumption, for instance, or the filters are polluted or improperly preserved.<p>

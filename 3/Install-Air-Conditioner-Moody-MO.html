<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>When installing radiant heat, you must give severe idea to the type of floor covering in the home. Ceramic tile works well because it conducts and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work reasonably well. Carpeting will straight insulate the floor from the space, decreasing performance, so if you want to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, utilize a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high use months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

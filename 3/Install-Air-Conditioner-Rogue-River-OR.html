<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out.

Temperature levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation should be prevented.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>

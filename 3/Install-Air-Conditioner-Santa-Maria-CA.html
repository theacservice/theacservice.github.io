<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>

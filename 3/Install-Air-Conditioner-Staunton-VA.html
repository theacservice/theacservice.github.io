The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Floor Heating System in Staunton VA</h3>
<p>Required air systems are the most typical heating system types on the market, but they're not always the very best option for each house. If you're looking for a brand-new heater for your house, you should take a look at a few of the other choices readily available before deciding on a system that might not fit your requirements best. Radiant heating, for instance, might be a better suitable for your needs.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short cycling in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm climate for your house when the weather is exceptionally cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you need clarity on this problem, contact one of our technicians.<p>

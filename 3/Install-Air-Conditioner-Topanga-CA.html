<p>Certain immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently tough to identify if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and location the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that need to be constantly provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>

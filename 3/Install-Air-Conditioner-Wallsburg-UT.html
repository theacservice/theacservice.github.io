<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>

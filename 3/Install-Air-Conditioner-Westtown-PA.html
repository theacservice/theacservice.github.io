<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

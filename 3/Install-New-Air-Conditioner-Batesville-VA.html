<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

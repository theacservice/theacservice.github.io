<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

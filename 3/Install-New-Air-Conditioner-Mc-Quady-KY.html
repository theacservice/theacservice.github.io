<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

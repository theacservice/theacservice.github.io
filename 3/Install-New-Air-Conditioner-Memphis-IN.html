No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating safely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>

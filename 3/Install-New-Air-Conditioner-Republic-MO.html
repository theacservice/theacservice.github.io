<p>Info provided in this security guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures continuously develop as a result of the modifications in the environment around them in addition to the residents, materials, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a building are continuously interacting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing slightly in time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

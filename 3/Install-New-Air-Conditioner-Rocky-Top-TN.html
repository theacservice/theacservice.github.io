<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For The Project in Rocky Top TN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Sandy OR</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

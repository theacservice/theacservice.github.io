HVAC experts suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

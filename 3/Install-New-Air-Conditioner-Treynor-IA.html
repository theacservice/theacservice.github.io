I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

These items present a danger just when they are handled in a way that develops dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if appropriate controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for substantial health problems.<p>

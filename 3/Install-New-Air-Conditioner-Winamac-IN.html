<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Andover MN</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>

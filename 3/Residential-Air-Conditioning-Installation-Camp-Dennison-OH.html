<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

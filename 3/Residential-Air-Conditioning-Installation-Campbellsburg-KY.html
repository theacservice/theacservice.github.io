<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Campbellsburg KY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there.

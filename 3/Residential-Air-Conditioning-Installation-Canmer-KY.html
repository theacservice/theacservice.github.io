<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

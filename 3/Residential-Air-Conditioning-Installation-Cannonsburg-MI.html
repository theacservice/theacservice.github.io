<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>

The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A fan belt, also referred to as a drive belt, is a belt connecting your cars and truck's engine to the front mounted devices. The fan belt rotates the water pump and engine fan, which preserves a cool environment for the engine and its components. Eventually, your car's fan belts will dry and crack.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back.

I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

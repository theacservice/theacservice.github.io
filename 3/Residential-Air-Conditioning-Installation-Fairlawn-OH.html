<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore in Fairlawn OH</h3>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

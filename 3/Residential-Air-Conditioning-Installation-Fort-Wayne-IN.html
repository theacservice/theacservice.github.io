<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software application.

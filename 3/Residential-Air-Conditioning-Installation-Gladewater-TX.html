Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>

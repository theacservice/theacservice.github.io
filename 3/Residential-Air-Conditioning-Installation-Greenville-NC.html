<h2>How To Hire HVAC Companies in Greenville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a lot of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

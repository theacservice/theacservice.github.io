<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

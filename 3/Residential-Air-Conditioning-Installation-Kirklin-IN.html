<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>

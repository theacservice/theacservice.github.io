<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

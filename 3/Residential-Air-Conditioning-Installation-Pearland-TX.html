<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Pearland Texas</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

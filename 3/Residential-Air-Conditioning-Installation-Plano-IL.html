<p>UW visitors, students and employees must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform various activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact an individual's comfort, efficiency, and health.

A key part of the program is reacting to and solving concerns of building residents about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

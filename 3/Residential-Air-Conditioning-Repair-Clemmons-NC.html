Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

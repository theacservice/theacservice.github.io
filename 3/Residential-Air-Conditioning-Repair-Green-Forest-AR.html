<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Green Forest Arkansas</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>

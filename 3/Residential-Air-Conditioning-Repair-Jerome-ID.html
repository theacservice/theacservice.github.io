<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air course. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, because all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

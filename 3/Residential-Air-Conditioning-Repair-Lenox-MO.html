<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>

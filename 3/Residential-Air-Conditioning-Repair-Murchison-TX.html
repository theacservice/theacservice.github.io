<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the manufacturer's instructions.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

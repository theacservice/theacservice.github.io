<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>

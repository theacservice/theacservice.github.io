<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

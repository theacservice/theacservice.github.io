EPA studies of human exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

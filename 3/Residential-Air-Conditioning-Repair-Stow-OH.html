<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While contaminant levels from private sources might not position a considerable health threat on their own, a lot of houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a severe risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>

<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses suddenly seem higher than regular, it is most likely time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is even more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills immediately, not to mention the money you'll minimize repair costs.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>

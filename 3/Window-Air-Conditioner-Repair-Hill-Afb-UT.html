<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.

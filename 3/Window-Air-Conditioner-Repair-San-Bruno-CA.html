<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

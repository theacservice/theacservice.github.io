They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My wife stated that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually met in a long time.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
